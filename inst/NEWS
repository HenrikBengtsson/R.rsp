Package: R.rsp
==============

Version: 0.9.17 [2013-07-28]
o CLEANUP: Dropped tempvar() now in R.utils v1.26.0.


Version: 0.9.16 [2013-07-26]
o GENERALIZATION: Now all return values are processed via generic
  function rpaste() before being outputted via cat().  This makes
  it possible (i) to override the default and (ii) to define class
  specific behaviors from within the RSP document itself.


Version: 0.9.15 [2013-07-19]
o Added capabilitiesOf(R.rsp) for easy summary of what tools are
  supported on the current system.  It is also possible to check
  support for a particular tool, e.g. isCapableOf(R.rsp, "latex").
o CLEANUP: Removed internal archive of old Tcl HTTP daemons.
o CLEANUP: Rewrote the package description.


Version: 0.9.14 [2013-07-18]
o BUG FIX: rstring(), rcat(), and rfile() on template function:s
  would only work if the evaluation was done in the default
  environment.  Added system tests for this.


Version: 0.9.13 [2013-07-17]
o CLEANUP: Internal code cleanup.
o BUG FIX: The automatic adding of a TEXINPUTS directory done by
  compileLaTeX() needed to add its absolute (not relative) path.


Version: 0.9.12 [2013-07-17]
o Now it possible to pass argument 'clean' all the way down to
  compileLaTeX() via rfile(), e.g. rfile("foo.tex.rsp", clean=TRUE).


Version: 0.9.11 [2013-07-16]
o Added rstring(), rcat() and rfile() for (template) function:s.
o ROBUSTNESS: Updated system tests to not use commas in LaTeX file
  paths, because such are not supported on all file systems.
o ROBUSTNESS: If compileLaTeX() was called on a LaTeX file in a
  directory different than the working directory, it could fail to
  located files to be included (e.g. image files).  In order to make
  this less likely to happen, compileLaTeX() now adds the the directory
  of the compiled LaTeX file to the TEXINPUTS search path, iff it is
  different than the working directory.


Version: 0.9.10 [2013-07-14]
o Added rfile() also for RspString, RspDocument and RspRSourceCode.
o BUG FIX: evaluate() for RspRSourceCode failed to evaluate in to
  proper environment if the default (parent) environment was used.


Version: 0.9.9 [2013-07-12]
o DOCUMENTATION: Updated the vignettes.
o Updated the template vignette Makefile that is needed prior
  to R v3.0.0 to no remove LaTeX files needed by R CMD check.
  These should instead be handled by .Rinstignore (a template
  for this is also available).


Version: 0.9.8 [2013-07-04]
o ROBUSTNESS: Added more tests on preprocessing.
o Internal code cleanup.
o Bumped up package dependencies.


Version: 0.9.7 [2013-05-25]
o Minor speedup by replacing rm() calls with NULL assignments.


Version: 0.9.6 [2013-05-23]
o ROBUSTNESS: Now rfile() handles files with only one filename extension.
o Several updates to browseRsp():
  - It automatically adds the current directory ('.') as well as a
    './rsp' subdirectory to the list of known root paths.
  - R.rsp::browseRsp() works without loading the package first.
  - It can be used to open any RSP file by specifying it's (absolute or
    relative) pathname, e.g. browseRsp("foo/bar.html.rsp") and
    browseRsp("foo/bar.md.rsp").
o Added argument 'trim=FALSE' to getParameter() and getParameters()
  for HttpRequest.
o Now processRsp() for HttpDaemon with version="1.0.0" utilizes
  rfile() rather than rstring() so that postprocessors are also
  applied.  Also, the rfile() working directory is set to the
  current directory (and not the directory of the source file
  as with version="0.1.0").  For backward compatibility with old
  RSP pages, write() for HttpDaemonRspResponse now supports the
  new RSP engine as well.  This will simplify the transition.


Version: 0.9.5 [2013-05-20]
o CRAN POLICY: Now all Rd \usage{} lines are at most 90 characters long.
o CRAN POLICY: Now all Rd example lines are at most 100 characters long.


Version: 0.9.4 [2013-05-18]
o DOCUMENTATION: Now vignettes are properly using opened and closed
  quotation marks.  Thanks Saunak Sen at UCSF for reporting on this.
o Now empty lines in .rspPlugins are ignored.


Version: 0.9.3 [2013-05-08]
o DOCUMENTATION: Explicitly added arguments 'file' & 'path' to
  rcat() to make the help page more user friendly [although
  they're just passed as is to rstring()].


Version: 0.9.2 [2013-04-04]
o The internal RSP engine has undergone a major redesign.
o BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY: The RSP processor of the built-in HTTP
  daemon is by default still using the previous RSP engine.
  Note, the built-in HTTP daemon is only there as a proof of
  concept and is not recommended for other than toy examples.


Version: 0.9.1 [2013-04-01]
o The internal RSP engine is undergoing a major redesign.
o Whenever only a URL directory is requested, the built-in HTTP daemon
  now loads the first file matching "^index[.](html|.*)$".  It used
  to only look for 'index.rsp'.


Version: 0.9.0 [2013-03-01]
o More functions can now be called without loading the package.
o DOCUMENTATION: Updated the help usage section for all static methods.
o Prepared package for the upcoming R (>= 3.0.0) generic vignette support.
o Simplified how to build non-Sweave vignettes for R (< 3.0.0).
  It now immitates how it is done in R (>= 3.0.0).


Version: 0.8.5 [2013-01-20]
o Now rsp() uses compileRnw() for *.Rnw files.
o Added compileRnw() which compiles Sweave and knitr Rnw files.
o Added typeOfRnw() which tries to infer whether an Rnw file is
  for Sweave or knitr based on its contents.
o ROBUSTNESS: Added system tests for compileKnitr(), compileRnw()
  and rsp() for handling Sweave and knitr Rnw files.
o Added 'knitr' under suggested packages.


Version: 0.8.4 [2012-12-19]
o Utilizing new startupMessage() of R.oo.


Version: 0.8.3 [2012-12-06]
o ROBUSTNESS: Added system tests for compileLaTeX(), compileSweave()
  and rsp().
o Added argument 'outPath' to compileLaTeX(), compileSweave() and rsp(),
  which is also the working directory.
o BUG FIX: compileLaTeX() and compileSweave() would return an incorrect
  pathname unless the source file was in the working directory.


Version: 0.8.2 [2012-06-22]
o ROBUSTNESS: Now the doc/Makefile no longer assumes 'R' is on
  the system's search path.  Instead it uses $(R_HOME)/bin/R.
  Thanks to Kasper Hansen at John Hopkins for the suggestion.


Version: 0.8.1 [2012-06-16]
o Now package only imports R.methodsS3 and R.oo instead of
  "depends" on them.


Version: 0.8.0 [2012-05-02]
o Now the package depends on R.devices, which contains the utility
  functions for graphical devices that originate from R.utils.


Version: 0.7.5 [2012-03-20]
o Now inst/doc/templates/Makefile does a better job cleaning up.


Version: 0.7.4 [2012-03-06]
o CRAN POLICY: Removed all internal copies of 'base' functions
  that contain .Internal().


Version: 0.7.3 [2012-02-28]
o Added toLatex() for LaTeX escaping character strings, cf.
  utils::toLatex() for 'sessionInfo' objects.


Version: 0.7.2 [2012-01-21]
o Placed a copy of inst/doc/Makefile in inst/doc/templates/ and
  updated the 'Include static PDFs and non-Sweave vignettes in
  an R package' vignette accordingly.  The reason for this change
  is that inst/doc/Makefile will not be installed in recent
  version of R.  The Makefile also does a better job cleaning up.


Version: 0.7.1 [2011-11-28]
o Now R.rsp::rsp() can be called without the package had been
  loaded before.


Version: 0.7.0 [2011-11-23]
o DOCUMENTATION: Added a vignette explaining how to include static
  PDFs and non-Sweave vignettes in an R package.
o Now the building of vignettes is independent of R.rsp.  All that
  is needed to build non-Sweave vignettes (via RSP, brew etc), or
  include a static PDF, is to have a corresponding *.Rnw stub with
  custom vignette options \VignetteSource{} and \VignetteBuild{}.
  See inst/doc/ of this package for more details.
o CLEANUP: Dropped an old vignette from 2006.


Version: 0.6.11 [2011-11-22]
o Now the *.tex.rsp vignettes are recognized by R.  This was done
  by tricking R to believe they are of Sweave origin.


Version: 0.6.10 [2011-11-17]
o ROBUSTNESS: Now the generated R script adds 'write <- R.rsp::write'
  at the beginning, to assure that it is used instead of base::write().


Version: 0.6.9 [2011-11-14]
o ROBUSTNESS: Now <%=[expr]%> is translated with curly brackets around
  the expression, i.e. write(response, {[expr]}).  This allows for
  writing <%= x <- 1; x^2 %> instead of <%={ x <- 1; x^2 }%>.
o BUG FIX: By default the RSP document would be evaluated in the
  local call frame of rsp(), not its parent frame.


Version: 0.6.8 [2011-11-07]
o BUG FIX: Although deprecated, the update to evalWithEcho() did not work.
o CLEANUP: Replaced an internal evalWithEcho() with evalCapture().


Version: 0.6.7 [2011-11-06]
o Updated code and vignettes to utilize evalCapture() of R.utils v1.9.2.
o DEPRECATED: evalWithEcho(); use evalCapture() instead.
o CLEANUP: Dropped the old 'The R.rsp package v0.3.0' vignette.


Version: 0.6.6 [2011-11-05]
o Updated the R.rsp vignette to utilize toPNG() of R.utils v1.9.1.


Version: 0.6.5 [2011-11-01]
o FIX: The package would not load in R v2.15.0 devel, because it
  tried to access restart(), which has been dropped.  This was
  a non-critical error and the fix was trivial.


Version: 0.6.4 [2011-10-21]
o Updated the package's DESCRIPTION with an example of the RSP syntax.


Version: 0.6.3 [2011-09-21]
o BUG FIX: HttpDaemon$getRootPaths() did not handle paths with
  spaces correctly.  Added a getRootPaths() Tcl function to
  instead handle this, which is called by the former.
o RSP PAGES: Added clarifications to the main index.rsp page.


Version: 0.6.2 [2011-07-27]
o CLEANUP: Replaced all references to 'R Server Pages' with RSP.
o RSP PAGES: Minor cleanup and harmonization.


Version: 0.6.1 [2011-07-24]
o Now package exports '.conflicts.OK' in order to avoid
  several warnings when loading package.


Version: 0.6.0 [2011-07-23]
o Added a namespace to the package, which will be more or less
  a requirement in the next major release of R.


Version: 0.5.4 [2011-05-05]
o ROBUSTNESS: Internal sourceWithTrim() no longer uses partial
  argument when calling source().


Version: 0.5.3 [2011-04-19]
o Added arguments 'clean' and 'quiet' to compileLaTeX().


Version: 0.5.2 [2011-04-18]
o Now browseRsp() pass '...' arguments to browseURL().
o DOCUMENTATION: Updated 'Dynamic LaTeX reports with RSP' vignette.


Version: 0.5.1 [2011-04-16]
o Now docs/Makefile cleans out all auxillary files.
o BUG FIX: On R v2.12.x, rsp(text="...") would throw 'Error ...: unused
  argument(s) (fileext = ".txt.rsp")'.  Solved by providing a patched
  tempfile() with this feature for R v2.12.x.  Thanks Uwe Ligges for
  spotting this.


Version: 0.5.0 [2011-04-14]
o Added rsp().
o Added compileLaTeX() and compileSweave().
o Changed RSP preprocess directives to have format <%#insert ...%>.
o DOCUMENTATION: Updated 'Dynamic LaTeX reports with RSP' vignette.
o CLEANUP: Cleaned up the help pages.


Version: 0.4.10 [2011-04-06]
o RSP PAGES: Added a demo page listing all built-in colors in R.
o RSP PAGES: Now the 'R Server Pages' page launched by browseRsp()
  list only the first package installation in case a package
  occurs in multiple package libraries in .libPaths().


Version: 0.4.9 [2011-04-04]
o Added support for RSP preprocessing directive <%@insert ...%>.


Version: 0.4.8 [2011-03-31]
o Now parseRsp() drops RSP comments, i.e. '<%-- {anything} --%>'.
o Rewrote evalWithEcho() so that it utilizes source(..., echo=TRUE).
o DOCUMENTATION: Additional updates on the 'Dynamic LaTeX reports
  with RSP' vignette.
o DOCUMENTATION: Now the RSP documentation is automatically
  generated when the package is built.


Version: 0.4.7 [2011-03-28]
o Additional updates on the 'Dynamic LaTeX reports with RSP' vignette.
o BUG FIX: write() for RspResponse classes would ignore arguments
  'collapse' and 'sep'.


Version: 0.4.6 [2011-03-12]
o Now the trimming of RSP handles all newline types, i.e. LF,
  CR+LF, and CR.  The corresponding argument 'trimRsp' now
  defaults to TRUE everywhere.
o BUG FIX: The main 'R Server Pages' page launched by browseRsp()
  would list package twice on a Windows system.
o CLEANUP: Some minor R code cleanups.


Version: 0.4.5 [2011-03-08]
o Updated getParameter() of HttpRequest to return all values of a
  query parameter with multiple entries.  Added argument 'drop'.
o BUG FIX: getHttpRequest() of HttpDaemon would drop all but the last
  of replicated query parameters of the same name, which for instance
  may occur if an HTML form with replicated checkboxes is used.
  Thanks to Truc Trung at University of Bergen, Norway, for this report.


Version: 0.4.4 [2011-03-08]
o Now rsptex() trims white space of RSP blocks so that RSP-only blocks
  no longer introduces newlines (that previously had to be escaped).
o Added argument 'trimRsp' to parseRsp() for trimming white spaces
  surrounding RSP blocks that have preceeding and succeeding white space
  and that are followed by a newline.  Currently it defaults to FALSE,
  but this may change in a future release.  The same was added to old
  translateRspV1() for compatibility reasons.  Note, compileRsp() and
  sourceRsp() will pass this argument down to these functions via '...'.


Version: 0.4.3 [2011-02-20]
o Now argument 'pdf' of rsptex() default to TRUE.
o DOCUMENTATION: Added example(rsptex).
o DOCUMENTATION: First draft of a article on how to generate
  dynamic reports by extending LaTeX with RSP.


Version: 0.4.2 [2011-02-14]
o DOCUMENTATION: Added a section to help(rsptex) explaining in what
  environment the RSP document is evaluated and how to retrieve it
  and its content.
o BUG FIX: parseRsp() would generate invalid R code/R comments for
  multiline <%=...%> statements.


Version: 0.4.1 [2011-01-06]
o DOCUMENTATION: Clarified in the help of HttpDaemon that it is only
  connections from the local host (127.0.0.1) that are accepted.
  This lowers the risk for unauthorized access to the R session.


Version: 0.4.0 [2010-09-15]
o BUG FIX: browseRsp(path="/R/settings/options.rsp") and
  browseRsp(path="/R/settings/par.rsp") was throwing "Error in
  help("par", pager = stdoutPager): unused argument(s)
  (pager = stdoutPager)" in R >= 2.10.0.


Version: 0.3.7 [2010-08-04]
o BUG FIX: browseRsp(path="/R/system/packages.rsp") would throw
  "Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): subscript out of bounds".


Version: 0.3.6 [2009-09-16]
o Updated the HTTP header generated by the builtin webserver from
  'HTTP/1.x [...]' to 'HTTP/1.1 [...]'.  Thanks Ryan Bressler
  (Institute for Systems Biology, Seattle) for reporting this.


Version: 0.3.5 [2009-02-23]
o Added rsptex() to compiling a *.tex.rsp file into a *.dvi file
  via *.tex.rsp -> *.tex.rsp.R -> *.tex -> *.dvi.
o Added compileRsp(), which utilizes internal translateRsp()
  which in turn calls parseRsp().
o Renamed old translateRsp() to translateRspV1(), which
  sourceRsp() is still utilizing.


Version: 0.3.4 [2008-03-06]
o BUG FIX: Regular expression pattern 'a-Z' is illegal on (at least)
  some locale, e.g. 'C' (where 'A-z' works). The only way to specify
  the ASCII alphabet is to list all characters explicitly, which we now
  do in all methods of the package.  See the r-devel thread
  "invalid regular expression '[a-Z]'" on 2008-03-05 for details.


Version: 0.3.3 [2007-06-10]
o Updated code such that package pass R CMD check R v2.6.0.
o BUG FIX: Removed obsolete code calling non-existing functions.


Version: 0.3.2 [2007-04-07]
o Replaced gsub pattern "\\\[\"\']" with "\\\\[\"\']" in
  indexOfNonQuoted().
o Replace regexpr pattern "^[ \]*=[ \]*" with "^[ \]*=[ \]*"
  in translateRsp().


Version: 0.3.1 [2007-01-07]
o Added rspToHtml() in order to simplify RSP-to-HTML compilations.


Version: 0.3.0 [2006-07-20]
o Package has now been verified to compile not only HTML input files,
  but also TeX files.  This make RSP a very power tool to write
  vignettes.  Added a simple package vignette.
o Packages with an rsp/ path (installed from inst/rsp/) will now
  be listed and linked to on the main RSP page.  This makes it very
  easy to add RSP pages to a package.  For an example, see the
  aroma.light package.
o Added browseRsp() for the Package too, e.g. browseRsp(aroma.light).
  Added help pages for these methods.
o When calling browseRsp(start=TRUE), (the parents of) all library
  paths are now added to the root paths.
o BUG FIX: translateRsp("\\\n") would convert to "\\n". Thanks
  Peter Dahlsgaard for the suggestion how to fix it using deparse().
o BUG FIX: translateRsp() would replicate last R code or text piece,
  for each RSP comment tag.


Version: 0.2.9 [2006-07-05]
o BUG FIX: If argument 'path' was NULL, translateRsp() gave an error.
  Thanks Julien Gagneur for pointing this out.


Version: 0.2.8 [2006-07-04]
o Renamed class Response to RspResponse and RspResponse to
  FileRspResponse, cf. HttpDaemonRspResponse.
o Now sourceRsp() creates an HttpRequest object internally, if not
  given.  Added an example to ?sourceRsp too.
o Added a little bit more help text.


Version: 0.2.7 [2006-06-13]
o BUG FIX: Used obsolete setClassS3() instead of setConstructorS3().


Version: 0.2.6 [2006-02-22]
o Added getParameters() to HttpRequest for completeness.
o The RSP page on "System Details" used functions only available
  on Windows platforms.
o BUG FIX: HttpDaemon$getHttpRequest() failed to retrieve
  parameters with empty values, e.g. "index.rsp?foo=&bar=2".


Version: 0.2.5 [2006-01-21]
o Added writeResponse() to HttpDaemon.  No other classes but
  HttpDaemon should know about the Tcl HTTP daemon.
o Improved the built-in RSP pages.
o Mozilla browsers does unfortunately not follow file URLs (file://)
  when clicking on links on a page that has been loaded via HTTP.
  This makes it impossible (for now) to link to local R help pages
  via RSP pages (without passing everything through the HTTP daemon
  that is). It works under Internet Explorer.
o Added more help.


Version: 0.2.4 [2006-01-11]
o BUG FIX: translateRsp() would in some locales give the error:
   simpleError in gsub(pattern, replacement, x, ignore.case,
   extended, fixed): 'replacement' is invalid in this locale
  This was due to an incorrect internal MAGIC.STRING.
  Thanks Julien Gagneur at EMBL/HTFG Center, Heidelberg for
  this bug fix.
o Create better support for plugins on the main RSP page.
o Updated example(HttpDaemon) so it actually runs and opens up
  the main RSP page (when in interactive mode).
o Added argument 'overwrite' to sourceAllRsp().
o Added argument 'overwrite' to constructor of RspResponse.


Version: 0.2.3 [2005-10-27]
o Removed the generation of doc/ from rsp files. Now all such
  documentation is supposed to viewed via the built in HTTP
  daemon.  This might change if/when a root ServletRequest
  class is written.


Version: 0.2.2 [2005-10-20]
o Now root paths can be set before the server has started.
o Updated the Tcl HTTP daemon so it can search multiple root
  directories for files to be processed.
o BUG FIX: HttpDaemon$startHelp() tried to open the wrong page.
o Update the RSP pages to include a common header with a navigator.
  Changes the CSS style to use sans serif etc.


Version: 0.2.1 [2005-10-15]
o BUG FIX: The HttpDaemon sent the wrong MIME type for *.rsp pages.
  Now text/html as it should be.


Version: 0.2.0 [2005-09-26]
o Added a simple webserver (HTTP Daemon) requiring Tcl, which now
  all R installation has.  The current version recognized and
  pre-process RSP files.
o BUG FIX: sourceRsp() is no longer using argument 'output',
  but 'response'.


Version: 0.1.3 [2005-09-18]
o The RSP template is now searching for a functional PNG device.
o Made a few method protected (and hence hid their documentation),
  because they are not of public interest.
o Added help to all methods.  R CMD check gives no warnings.


Version: 0.1.2 [2005-08-15]
o All output is first interpreted as a GString before being written.
o Added support for page directive with attribute 'import'.
o More robust search for '%>'; tries to make sure the ending tag
  is not within a character string.


Version: 0.1.1 [2005-08-02]
o If an error occurs with an RSP file when running sourceAllRsp(),
  it smoothly continues with the next file instead of interrupting.
o Clean up and added help pages to all methods and classes.
o Now the "User Guides and Package Vignettes" documentation is
  build from RSP files when re-building man pages from Rdoc comments.


Version: 0.1.0 [2005-07-26]
o Created.  Since May 2002, there has been a trial version of an
  RSPEngine class in the R.io package, but from now on this package
  should be used for RSP processing.  The RSPEngine class is made
  deprecated.
