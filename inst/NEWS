Package: R.rsp
==============

Version: 0.4.9 [2011-04-01]
o Added support for RSP preprocessing directive <%@insert ...%>.


Version: 0.4.8 [2011-03-31]
o Now parseRsp() drops RSP comments, i.e. '<%-- {anything} --%>'.
o Rewrote evalWithEcho() so that it utilizes source(..., echo=TRUE).
o DOCUMENTATION: Additional updates on the 'Dynamic LaTeX reports 
  with RSP' vignette.
o DOCUMENTATION: Now the RSP documentation is automatically
  generated when the package is built.


Version: 0.4.7 [2011-03-28]
o Additional updates on the 'Dynamic LaTeX reports with RSP' vignette.
o BUG FIX: write() for RspResponse classes would ignore arguments
  'collapse' and 'sep'.


Version: 0.4.6 [2011-03-12]
o Now the trimming of RSP handles all newline types, i.e. LF, 
  CR+LF, and CR.  The corresponding argument 'trimRsp' now 
  defaults to TRUE everywhere.
o BUG FIX: The main 'R Server Pages' page launched by browseRsp()
  would list package twice on a Windows system.
o CLEANUP: Some minor R code cleanups.


Version: 0.4.5 [2011-03-08]
o Updated getParameter() of HttpRequest to return all values of a
  query parameter with multiple entries.  Added argument 'drop'.
o BUG FIX: getHttpRequest() of HttpDaemon would drop all but the last
  of replicated query parameters of the same name, which for instance
  may occur if an HTML form with replicated checkboxes is used.
  Thanks to Truc Trung at University of Bergen, Norway, for this report.


Version: 0.4.4 [2011-03-08]
o Now rsptex() trims white space of RSP blocks so that RSP-only blocks
  no longer introduces newlines (that previously had to be escaped).
o Added argument 'trimRsp' to parseRsp() for trimming white spaces
  surrounding RSP blocks that have preceeding and succeeding white space
  and that are followed by a newline.  Currently it defaults to FALSE,
  but this may change in a future release.  The same was added to old
  translateRspV1() for compatibility reasons.  Note, compileRsp() and
  sourceRsp() will pass this argument down to these functions via '...'.


Version: 0.4.3 [2011-02-20]
o Now argument 'pdf' of rsptex() default to TRUE.
o DOCUMENTATION: Added example(rsptex).
o DOCUMENTATION: First draft of a article on how to generate
  dynamic reports by extending LaTeX with RSP.


Version: 0.4.2 [2011-02-14]
o DOCUMENTATION: Added a section to help(rsptex) explaining in what 
  environment the RSP document is evaluated and how to retrieve it 
  and its content.
o BUG FIX: parseRsp() would generate invalid R code/R comments for
  multiline <%=...%> statements.


Version: 0.4.1 [2011-01-06]
o DOCUMENTATION: Clarified in the help of HttpDaemon that it is only 
  connections from the local host (127.0.0.1) that are accepted.
  This lowers the risk for unauthorized access to the R session.


Version: 0.4.0 [2010-09-15]
o BUG FIX: browseRsp(path="/R/settings/options.rsp") and
  browseRsp(path="/R/settings/par.rsp") was throwing "Error in
  help("par", pager = stdoutPager): unused argument(s) 
  (pager = stdoutPager)" in R >= 2.10.0.


Version: 0.3.7 [2010-08-04]
o BUG FIX: browseRsp(path="/R/system/packages.rsp") would throw
  "Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): subscript out of bounds".


Version: 0.3.6 [2009-09-16]
o Updated the HTTP header generated by the builtin webserver from
  'HTTP/1.x [...]' to 'HTTP/1.1 [...]'.  Thanks Ryan Bressler
  (Institute for Systems Biology, Seattle) for reporting this.


Version: 0.3.5 [2009-02-23]
o Added rsptex() to compiling a *.tex.rsp file into a *.dvi file
  via *.tex.rsp -> *.tex.rsp.R -> *.tex -> *.dvi.
o Added compileRsp(), which utilizes internal translateRsp() 
  which in turn calls parseRsp().
o Renamed old translateRsp() to translateRspV1(), which 
  sourceRsp() is still utilizing.


Version: 0.3.4 [2008-03-06]
o BUG FIX: Regular expression pattern 'a-Z' is illegal on (at least) 
  some locale, e.g. 'C' (where 'A-z' works). The only way to specify 
  the ASCII alphabet is to list all characters explicitly, which we now
  do in all methods of the package.  See the r-devel thread 
  "invalid regular expression '[a-Z]'" on 2008-03-05 for details.


Version: 0.3.3 [2007-06-10]
o Updated code such that package pass R CMD check R v2.6.0.
o BUG FIX: Removed obsolete code calling non-existing functions.


Version: 0.3.2 [2007-04-07]
o Replaced gsub pattern "\\\[\"\']" with "\\\\[\"\']" in
  indexOfNonQuoted().
o Replace regexpr pattern "^[ \]*=[ \]*" with "^[ \]*=[ \]*"
  in translateRsp().


Version: 0.3.1 [2007-01-07]
o Added rspToHtml() in order to simplify RSP-to-HTML compilations.


Version: 0.3.0 [2006-07-20]
o Package has now been verified to compile not only HTML input files,
  but also TeX files.  This make RSP a very power tool to write 
  vignettes.  Added a simple package vignette.
o Packages with an rsp/ path (installed from inst/rsp/) will now
  be listed and linked to on the main RSP page.  This makes it very
  easy to add RSP pages to a package.  For an example, see the
  aroma.light package.
o Added browseRsp() for the Package too, e.g. browseRsp(aroma.light).
  Added help pages for these methods.
o When calling browseRsp(start=TRUE), (the parents of) all library 
  paths are now added to the root paths.
o BUG FIX: translateRsp("\\\n") would convert to "\\n". Thanks 
  Peter Dahlsgaard for the suggestion how to fix it using deparse().
o BUG FIX: translateRsp() would replicate last R code or text piece,
  for each RSP comment tag.


Version: 0.2.9 [2006-07-05]
o BUG FIX: If argument 'path' was NULL, translateRsp() gave an error.
  Thanks Julien Gagneur for pointing this out.


Version: 0.2.8 [2006-07-04]
o Renamed class Response to RspResponse and RspResponse to 
  FileRspResponse, cf. HttpDaemonRspResponse.
o Now sourceRsp() creates an HttpRequest object internally, if not 
  given.  Added an example to ?sourceRsp too.
o Added a little bit more help text.


Version: 0.2.7 [2006-06-13]
o BUG FIX: Used obsolete setClassS3() instead of setConstructorS3().


Version: 0.2.6 [2006-02-22]
o Added getParameters() to HttpRequest for completeness.
o The RSP page on "System Details" used functions only available
  on Windows platforms.
o BUG FIX: HttpDaemon$getHttpRequest() failed to retrieve 
  parameters with empty values, e.g. "index.rsp?foo=&bar=2".


Version: 0.2.5 [2006-01-21]
o Added writeResponse() to HttpDaemon.  No other classes but
  HttpDaemon should know about the Tcl HTTP daemon.
o Improved the built-in RSP pages.
o Mozilla browsers does unfortunately not follow file URLs (file://)
  when clicking on links on a page that has been loaded via HTTP.
  This makes it impossible (for now) to link to local R help pages 
  via RSP pages (without passing everything through the HTTP daemon
  that is). It works under Internet Explorer.
o Added more help.


Version: 0.2.4 [2006-01-11]
o BUG FIX: translateRsp() would in some locales give the error:
   simpleError in gsub(pattern, replacement, x, ignore.case, 
   extended, fixed): 'replacement' is invalid in this locale
  This was due to an incorrect internal MAGIC.STRING.
  Thanks Julien Gagneur at EMBL/HTFG Center, Heidelberg for 
  this bug fix.
o Create better support for plugins on the main RSP page.
o Updated example(HttpDaemon) so it actually runs and opens up
  the main RSP page (when in interactive mode).
o Added argument 'overwrite' to sourceAllRsp().
o Added argument 'overwrite' to constructor of RspResponse.


Version: 0.2.3 [2005-10-27]
o Removed the generation of doc/ from rsp files. Now all such
  documentation is supposed to viewed via the built in HTTP
  daemon.  This might change if/when a root ServletRequest 
  class is written.


Version: 0.2.2 [2005-10-20]
o Now root paths can be set before the server has started.
o Updated the Tcl HTTP daemon so it can search multiple root 
  directories for files to be processed.
o BUG FIX: HttpDaemon$startHelp() tried to open the wrong page.
o Update the RSP pages to include a common header with a navigator.
  Changes the CSS style to use sans serif etc.


Version: 0.2.1 [2005-10-15]
o BUG FIX: The HttpDaemon sent the wrong MIME type for *.rsp pages. 
  Now text/html as it should be.


Version: 0.2.0 [2005-09-26]
o Added a simple webserver (HTTP Daemon) requiring Tcl, which now
  all R installation has.  The current version recognized and 
  pre-process RSP files.  
o BUG FIX: sourceRsp() is no longer using argument 'output', 
  but 'response'.


Version: 0.1.3 [2005-09-18]
o The RSP template is now searching for a functional PNG device.
o Made a few method protected (and hence hid their documentation), 
  because they are not of public interest.
o Added help to all methods.  R CMD check gives no warnings.


Version: 0.1.2 [2005-08-15]
o All output is first interpreted as a GString before being written.
o Added support for page directive with attribute 'import'.
o More robust search for '%>'; tries to make sure the ending tag
  is not within a character string.


Version: 0.1.1 [2005-08-02]
o If an error occurs with an RSP file when running sourceAllRsp(),
  it smoothly continues with the next file instead of interrupting.
o Clean up and added help pages to all methods and classes.
o Now the "User Guides and Package Vignettes" documentation is
  build from RSP files when re-building man pages from Rdoc comments.


Version: 0.1.0 [2005-07-26]
o Created.  Since May 2005, there has been a trial version of an 
  RSPEngine class in the R.io package, but from now on this package
  should be used for RSP processing.  The RSPEngine class is made
  deprecated.
