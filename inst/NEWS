Package: R.rsp
==============

Version: 0.8.2 [2012-06-22]
o ROBUSTNESS: Now the doc/Makefile no longer assumes 'R' is on 
  the system's search path.  Instead it uses $(R_HOME)/bin/R. 
  Thanks to Kasper Hansen at John Hopkins for the suggestion.


Version: 0.8.1 [2012-06-16]
o Now package only imports R.methodsS3 and R.oo instead of
  "depends" on them.


Version: 0.8.0 [2012-05-02]
o Now the package depends on R.devices, which contains the utility
  functions for graphical devices that originates from R.utils.


Version: 0.7.5 [2012-03-20]
o Now inst/doc/templates/Makefile does a better job cleaning up.


Version: 0.7.4 [2012-03-06]
o CRAN POLICY: Removed all internal copies of 'base' functions
  that contain .Internal().


Version: 0.7.3 [2012-02-28]
o Added toLatex() for LaTeX escaping character strings, cf.
  utils::toLatex() for 'sessionInfo' objects.


Version: 0.7.2 [2012-01-21]
o Placed a copy of inst/doc/Makefile in inst/doc/templates/ and
  updated the 'Include static PDFs and non-Sweave vignettes in 
  an R package' vignette accordingly.  The reason for this change
  is that inst/doc/Makefile will not be installed in recent
  version of R.  The Makefile also does a better job cleaning up.


Version: 0.7.1 [2011-11-28]
o Now R.rsp::rsp() can be called without the package had been
  loaded before.


Version: 0.7.0 [2011-11-23]
o DOCUMENTATION: Added a vignette explaining how to include static
  PDFs and non-Sweave vignettes in an R package.
o Now the building of vignettes is independent of R.rsp.  All that
  is needed to build non-Sweave vignettes (via RSP, brew etc), or 
  include a static PDF, is to have a corresponding *.Rnw stub with 
  custom vignette options \VignetteSource{} and \VignetteBuild{}.
  See inst/doc/ of this package for more details.
o CLEANUP: Dropped an old vignette from 2006.


Version: 0.6.11 [2011-11-22]
o Now the *.tex.rsp vignettes are recognized by R.  This was done
  by tricking R to believe they are of Sweave origin.


Version: 0.6.10 [2011-11-17]
o ROBUSTNESS: Now the generated R script adds 'write <- R.rsp::write'
  at the beginning, to assure that it is used instead of base::write().


Version: 0.6.9 [2011-11-14]
o ROBUSTNESS: Now <%=[expr]%> is translated with curly brackets around
  the expression, i.e. write(response, {[expr]}).  This allows for
  writing <%= x <- 1; x^2 %> instead of <%={ x <- 1; x^2 }%>.   
o BUG FIX: By default the RSP document would be evaluated in the
  local call frame of rsp(), not its parent frame.


Version: 0.6.8 [2011-11-07]
o BUG FIX: Although deprecated, the update to evalWithEcho() did not work.
o CLEANUP: Replaced an internal evalWithEcho() with evalCapture().


Version: 0.6.7 [2011-11-06]
o Updated code and vignettes to utilize evalCapture() of R.utils v1.9.2.
o DEPRECATED: evalWithEcho(); use evalCapture() instead.
o CLEANUP: Dropped the old 'The R.rsp package v0.3.0' vignette.


Version: 0.6.6 [2011-11-05]
o Updated the R.rsp vignette to utilize toPNG() of R.utils v1.9.1.


Version: 0.6.5 [2011-11-01]
o FIX: The package would not load in R v2.15.0 devel, because it
  tried to access restart(), which has been dropped.  This was
  a non-critical error and the fix was trivial.
  

Version: 0.6.4 [2011-10-21]
o Updated the package's DESCRIPTION with an example of the RSP syntax.


Version: 0.6.3 [2011-09-21]
o BUG FIX: HttpDaemon$getRootPaths() did not handle paths with
  spaces correctly.  Added a getRootPaths() Tcl function to
  instead handle this, which is called by the former.
o RSP PAGES: Added clarifications to the main index.rsp page.


Version: 0.6.2 [2011-07-27]
o CLEANUP: Replaced all references to 'R Server Pages' with RSP.
o RSP PAGES: Minor cleanup and harmonization.


Version: 0.6.1 [2011-07-24]
o Now package exports '.conflicts.OK' in order to avoid
  several warnings when loading package.


Version: 0.6.0 [2011-07-23]
o Added a namespace to the package, which will be more or less
  a requirement in the next major release of R.


Version: 0.5.4 [2011-05-05]
o ROBUSTNESS: Internal sourceWithTrim() no longer uses partial
  argument when calling source().


Version: 0.5.3 [2011-04-19]
o Added arguments 'clean' and 'quiet' to compileLaTeX().


Version: 0.5.2 [2011-04-18]
o Now browseRsp() pass '...' arguments to browseURL().
o DOCUMENTATION: Updated 'Dynamic LaTeX reports with RSP' vignette. 


Version: 0.5.1 [2011-04-16]
o Now docs/Makefile cleans out all auxillary files.
o BUG FIX: On R v2.12.x, rsp(text="...") would throw 'Error ...: unused
  argument(s) (fileext = ".txt.rsp")'.  Solved by providing a patched
  tempfile() with this feature for R v2.12.x.  Thanks Uwe Ligges for
  spotting this.


Version: 0.5.0 [2011-04-14]
o Added rsp().
o Added compileLaTeX() and compileSweave().
o Changed RSP preprocess directives to have format <%#insert ...%>.
o DOCUMENTATION: Updated 'Dynamic LaTeX reports with RSP' vignette.
o CLEANUP: Cleaned up the help pages.


Version: 0.4.10 [2011-04-06]
o RSP PAGES: Added a demo page listing all built-in colors in R.
o RSP PAGES: Now the 'R Server Pages' page launched by browseRsp()
  list only the first package installation in case a package
  occurs in multiple package libraries in .libPaths().


Version: 0.4.9 [2011-04-04]
o Added support for RSP preprocessing directive <%@insert ...%>.


Version: 0.4.8 [2011-03-31]
o Now parseRsp() drops RSP comments, i.e. '<%-- {anything} --%>'.
o Rewrote evalWithEcho() so that it utilizes source(..., echo=TRUE).
o DOCUMENTATION: Additional updates on the 'Dynamic LaTeX reports 
  with RSP' vignette.
o DOCUMENTATION: Now the RSP documentation is automatically
  generated when the package is built.


Version: 0.4.7 [2011-03-28]
o Additional updates on the 'Dynamic LaTeX reports with RSP' vignette.
o BUG FIX: write() for RspResponse classes would ignore arguments
  'collapse' and 'sep'.


Version: 0.4.6 [2011-03-12]
o Now the trimming of RSP handles all newline types, i.e. LF, 
  CR+LF, and CR.  The corresponding argument 'trimRsp' now 
  defaults to TRUE everywhere.
o BUG FIX: The main 'R Server Pages' page launched by browseRsp()
  would list package twice on a Windows system.
o CLEANUP: Some minor R code cleanups.


Version: 0.4.5 [2011-03-08]
o Updated getParameter() of HttpRequest to return all values of a
  query parameter with multiple entries.  Added argument 'drop'.
o BUG FIX: getHttpRequest() of HttpDaemon would drop all but the last
  of replicated query parameters of the same name, which for instance
  may occur if an HTML form with replicated checkboxes is used.
  Thanks to Truc Trung at University of Bergen, Norway, for this report.


Version: 0.4.4 [2011-03-08]
o Now rsptex() trims white space of RSP blocks so that RSP-only blocks
  no longer introduces newlines (that previously had to be escaped).
o Added argument 'trimRsp' to parseRsp() for trimming white spaces
  surrounding RSP blocks that have preceeding and succeeding white space
  and that are followed by a newline.  Currently it defaults to FALSE,
  but this may change in a future release.  The same was added to old
  translateRspV1() for compatibility reasons.  Note, compileRsp() and
  sourceRsp() will pass this argument down to these functions via '...'.


Version: 0.4.3 [2011-02-20]
o Now argument 'pdf' of rsptex() default to TRUE.
o DOCUMENTATION: Added example(rsptex).
o DOCUMENTATION: First draft of a article on how to generate
  dynamic reports by extending LaTeX with RSP.


Version: 0.4.2 [2011-02-14]
o DOCUMENTATION: Added a section to help(rsptex) explaining in what 
  environment the RSP document is evaluated and how to retrieve it 
  and its content.
o BUG FIX: parseRsp() would generate invalid R code/R comments for
  multiline <%=...%> statements.


Version: 0.4.1 [2011-01-06]
o DOCUMENTATION: Clarified in the help of HttpDaemon that it is only 
  connections from the local host (127.0.0.1) that are accepted.
  This lowers the risk for unauthorized access to the R session.


Version: 0.4.0 [2010-09-15]
o BUG FIX: browseRsp(path="/R/settings/options.rsp") and
  browseRsp(path="/R/settings/par.rsp") was throwing "Error in
  help("par", pager = stdoutPager): unused argument(s) 
  (pager = stdoutPager)" in R >= 2.10.0.


Version: 0.3.7 [2010-08-04]
o BUG FIX: browseRsp(path="/R/system/packages.rsp") would throw
  "Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): subscript out of bounds".


Version: 0.3.6 [2009-09-16]
o Updated the HTTP header generated by the builtin webserver from
  'HTTP/1.x [...]' to 'HTTP/1.1 [...]'.  Thanks Ryan Bressler
  (Institute for Systems Biology, Seattle) for reporting this.


Version: 0.3.5 [2009-02-23]
o Added rsptex() to compiling a *.tex.rsp file into a *.dvi file
  via *.tex.rsp -> *.tex.rsp.R -> *.tex -> *.dvi.
o Added compileRsp(), which utilizes internal translateRsp() 
  which in turn calls parseRsp().
o Renamed old translateRsp() to translateRspV1(), which 
  sourceRsp() is still utilizing.


Version: 0.3.4 [2008-03-06]
o BUG FIX: Regular expression pattern 'a-Z' is illegal on (at least) 
  some locale, e.g. 'C' (where 'A-z' works). The only way to specify 
  the ASCII alphabet is to list all characters explicitly, which we now
  do in all methods of the package.  See the r-devel thread 
  "invalid regular expression '[a-Z]'" on 2008-03-05 for details.


Version: 0.3.3 [2007-06-10]
o Updated code such that package pass R CMD check R v2.6.0.
o BUG FIX: Removed obsolete code calling non-existing functions.


Version: 0.3.2 [2007-04-07]
o Replaced gsub pattern "\\\[\"\']" with "\\\\[\"\']" in
  indexOfNonQuoted().
o Replace regexpr pattern "^[ \]*=[ \]*" with "^[ \]*=[ \]*"
  in translateRsp().


Version: 0.3.1 [2007-01-07]
o Added rspToHtml() in order to simplify RSP-to-HTML compilations.


Version: 0.3.0 [2006-07-20]
o Package has now been verified to compile not only HTML input files,
  but also TeX files.  This make RSP a very power tool to write 
  vignettes.  Added a simple package vignette.
o Packages with an rsp/ path (installed from inst/rsp/) will now
  be listed and linked to on the main RSP page.  This makes it very
  easy to add RSP pages to a package.  For an example, see the
  aroma.light package.
o Added browseRsp() for the Package too, e.g. browseRsp(aroma.light).
  Added help pages for these methods.
o When calling browseRsp(start=TRUE), (the parents of) all library 
  paths are now added to the root paths.
o BUG FIX: translateRsp("\\\n") would convert to "\\n". Thanks 
  Peter Dahlsgaard for the suggestion how to fix it using deparse().
o BUG FIX: translateRsp() would replicate last R code or text piece,
  for each RSP comment tag.


Version: 0.2.9 [2006-07-05]
o BUG FIX: If argument 'path' was NULL, translateRsp() gave an error.
  Thanks Julien Gagneur for pointing this out.


Version: 0.2.8 [2006-07-04]
o Renamed class Response to RspResponse and RspResponse to 
  FileRspResponse, cf. HttpDaemonRspResponse.
o Now sourceRsp() creates an HttpRequest object internally, if not 
  given.  Added an example to ?sourceRsp too.
o Added a little bit more help text.


Version: 0.2.7 [2006-06-13]
o BUG FIX: Used obsolete setClassS3() instead of setConstructorS3().


Version: 0.2.6 [2006-02-22]
o Added getParameters() to HttpRequest for completeness.
o The RSP page on "System Details" used functions only available
  on Windows platforms.
o BUG FIX: HttpDaemon$getHttpRequest() failed to retrieve 
  parameters with empty values, e.g. "index.rsp?foo=&bar=2".


Version: 0.2.5 [2006-01-21]
o Added writeResponse() to HttpDaemon.  No other classes but
  HttpDaemon should know about the Tcl HTTP daemon.
o Improved the built-in RSP pages.
o Mozilla browsers does unfortunately not follow file URLs (file://)
  when clicking on links on a page that has been loaded via HTTP.
  This makes it impossible (for now) to link to local R help pages 
  via RSP pages (without passing everything through the HTTP daemon
  that is). It works under Internet Explorer.
o Added more help.


Version: 0.2.4 [2006-01-11]
o BUG FIX: translateRsp() would in some locales give the error:
   simpleError in gsub(pattern, replacement, x, ignore.case, 
   extended, fixed): 'replacement' is invalid in this locale
  This was due to an incorrect internal MAGIC.STRING.
  Thanks Julien Gagneur at EMBL/HTFG Center, Heidelberg for 
  this bug fix.
o Create better support for plugins on the main RSP page.
o Updated example(HttpDaemon) so it actually runs and opens up
  the main RSP page (when in interactive mode).
o Added argument 'overwrite' to sourceAllRsp().
o Added argument 'overwrite' to constructor of RspResponse.


Version: 0.2.3 [2005-10-27]
o Removed the generation of doc/ from rsp files. Now all such
  documentation is supposed to viewed via the built in HTTP
  daemon.  This might change if/when a root ServletRequest 
  class is written.


Version: 0.2.2 [2005-10-20]
o Now root paths can be set before the server has started.
o Updated the Tcl HTTP daemon so it can search multiple root 
  directories for files to be processed.
o BUG FIX: HttpDaemon$startHelp() tried to open the wrong page.
o Update the RSP pages to include a common header with a navigator.
  Changes the CSS style to use sans serif etc.


Version: 0.2.1 [2005-10-15]
o BUG FIX: The HttpDaemon sent the wrong MIME type for *.rsp pages. 
  Now text/html as it should be.


Version: 0.2.0 [2005-09-26]
o Added a simple webserver (HTTP Daemon) requiring Tcl, which now
  all R installation has.  The current version recognized and 
  pre-process RSP files.  
o BUG FIX: sourceRsp() is no longer using argument 'output', 
  but 'response'.


Version: 0.1.3 [2005-09-18]
o The RSP template is now searching for a functional PNG device.
o Made a few method protected (and hence hid their documentation), 
  because they are not of public interest.
o Added help to all methods.  R CMD check gives no warnings.


Version: 0.1.2 [2005-08-15]
o All output is first interpreted as a GString before being written.
o Added support for page directive with attribute 'import'.
o More robust search for '%>'; tries to make sure the ending tag
  is not within a character string.


Version: 0.1.1 [2005-08-02]
o If an error occurs with an RSP file when running sourceAllRsp(),
  it smoothly continues with the next file instead of interrupting.
o Clean up and added help pages to all methods and classes.
o Now the "User Guides and Package Vignettes" documentation is
  build from RSP files when re-building man pages from Rdoc comments.


Version: 0.1.0 [2005-07-26]
o Created.  Since May 2002, there has been a trial version of an 
  RSPEngine class in the R.io package, but from now on this package
  should be used for RSP processing.  The RSPEngine class is made
  deprecated.
