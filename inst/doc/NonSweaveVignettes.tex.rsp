\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
This document describes how to include static PDFs and non-Sweave vignettes in an R package such that they appear in the R help system.   Generic support for vignettes of any format (not only Sweave) was added in R~v3.0.0 (see `Writing R Extensions' for more details).   The instructions given here are intendend for packages that are to be built and installed on R systems prior to R v3.0.0.  However, the instructions have been adjusted such that they are forward compatible with the new R~v3.0.0 system.

  BACKGROUND
  -------------------------------------------------------------------%>
\section{Background}
When building an R package, Sweave/LaTeX vignettes are recognized by R, compiled into PDFs, which are listed along with their source in the R help system, e.g. \code{help.start()}.  These package vignettes are also being listed online on the CRAN and Bioconductor package pages.

Unfortunately, as of R~v2.14.0, static PDFs are not recognized and therefore not listed.  Same is true for other PDFs that are dynamically generated during build by other means, e.g. RSP-embedded LaTeX documents.  Fortunately, there is a framework to include also non-Sweave vignettes, as explained next.


<%-------------------------------------------------------------------
  STATIC PDFS
  -------------------------------------------------------------------%>
\section{Using the default R framework}
\subsection{Include static PDFs}
\label{secStaticPDF}
Assume you have a static PDF named \file{manual.pdf} that you wish to include in your package.  Then place it in the \file{inst/doc/} directory of the package and create a corresponding \file{manual.Rnw} stub (in the same directory) that contains:
\begin{alltt}
%{\bs}VignetteIndexEntry\{User manual\}
{\bs}documentclass\{article\}
{\bs}begin\{document\}
{\bs}end\{document\}
\end{alltt}
The above is a minimal valid Sweave document that is recognized by the R build system.
This small addition will make the vignette appear when calling \code{browseVignettes()} as well as in the `Overview of user guides and package vignettes' section of the package HTML help page (via \code{help.start()}).


<%-------------------------------------------------------------------
  RSP VIGNETTES
  -------------------------------------------------------------------%>
\section{Using the extended framework of the R.rsp package}
<% pathMk <- file.path("doc", "templates", fsep="/"); %>
In this section, we describe how to dynamically build and include non-Sweave vignettes, such as, but not limited to, RSP-embedded LaTeX vignettes.  In order to do this, a customized \file{Makefile} needs to be added to the package's \file{inst/doc/} directory.  The Makefile is available in the \pkg{R.rsp} package (see Appendix for its content).  You can copy it to the current directory by:
\begin{verbatim}
pathname <- system.file("<%=pathMk%>/Makefile", package="R.rsp")
file.copy(pathname, to=".")
\end{verbatim}
This Makefile, which does not have to be edited, utilizes a few utility functions that are available in the \pkg{R.rsp} package.  Note that the Makefile and the utility functions are independent of the RSP markup language\footnote{In the future, we may move the customized Makefile and its utility functions to the \pkg{R.utils} package.}.
The use of a custom \file{inst/doc/Makefile} is described in Section `Writing package vignettes' of `Writing R Extensions' (via for instance \code{help.start()}).


\subsection{Improved HTML overview of vignettes}
By default, the R HTML help system will list links to the PDF and the Sweave source of the vignettes.  This means that above approach for including static PDFs in a package will also list the Rnw stub in this listing.
As explained in `Writing R Extensions', it is possible to override this by providing a custom \file{inst/doc/index.html} file.
It can be tedious the manually edit the \file{index.html} file.  For this reason, if the \file{index.html} file is missing, then the above \file{Makefile} automatically builds one and populates it with the PDF and source files available according to what the vignette files specify (see also below).


\subsection{Include RSP-embedded LaTeX vignettes}
\label{secRSPVignette}
Assume you have an RSP-embedded LaTeX vignette named \file{manual.tex.rsp} that you wish to automatically build and have the PDF and the source being include in your package.  In order for this to happen, it must be contain \code{{\bs}Vignette*\{\}} markup as illustrated below:
\begin{alltt}
%{\bs}VignetteIndexEntry\{User manual\}
%{\bs}VignetteEngine\{R.rsp::rsp\}
{\bs}documentclass\{article\}
{\bs}begin\{document\}
{\bs}end\{document\}
\end{alltt}
Make sure these statements are given within comments in your vignette source document.
The \code{{\bs}VignetteIndexEntry\{\}} markup sets the title of the vignette as it will appear in the R vignette index.
The \code{{\bs}VignetteEngine\{\}} markup specifies which vignette engine to use for compiling this vignette source file.  This markup is actually only available in R~v3.0.0, but we use it here too and somewhat immitates its behavior such that it works in any version of R.  In order for this to work in R prior to R~v3.0.0, you also have to specify add a \code{enginesMap.R} file to \code{inst/doc/} that looks like:
{\scriptsize\begin{verbatim}
<%=
pathname <- system.file(pathMk, "enginesMap.R", package="R.rsp");
bfr <- readLines(pathname, warn=FALSE);
paste(bfr, collapse="\n");
%>
\end{verbatim}}
When building vignettes via the Makefile, this file will be sourced to define vignette compile functions that have names equal to the ones specified by the \code{{\bs}VignetteEngine\{\}} statements in your vignettes.

\section*{Appendix}
\subsection*{The customized Makefile}
\label{appMakefile}
The customized Makefile that builds non-Sweave vignettes and missing \file{/inst/doc/index.html} files is available in \pkg{R.rsp} package directory \file{<%=pathMk%>/}.  Its content is:
{\scriptsize\begin{verbatim}
<%=
pathname <- system.file(pathMk, "Makefile", package="R.rsp");
bfr <- readLines(pathname, warn=FALSE);
rr <- grep("^# HISTORY", bfr);
if (length(rr) > 0) {
  bfr <- bfr[1:(rr-2L)];
}
bfr <- gsub("\t", "    ", bfr, fixed=TRUE);
paste(bfr, collapse="\n");
%>
\end{verbatim}}

\subsection*{The files used for creating this document}
\label{appThisRnw}
This document was created the RSP-embedded LaTeX vignette \file{NonSweaveVignettes.tex.rsp} located in the \file{doc/} package directory of \pkg{R.rsp}.  It can manually be compiled into a PDF as:
\begin{verbatim}
pathname <- system.file("doc/NonSweaveVignettes.tex.rsp", package="R.rsp");
R.rsp::file(pathname);
\end{verbatim}
The generated PDF can then be included into the package as a static PDF (as explained in Section~\ref{secStaticPDF}).
However, in this package we have choosen to build it dynamically during package build, by adding it to \file{inst/doc/} as explained in Section~\ref{secRSPVignette}.

\subsection*{Session information}
<%=toLatex(sessionInfo())%>
This report was automatically generated using \code{rfile()} of the R.rsp package.
Total processing time after RSP-to-R translation was <%=dt <- round(Sys.time()-t0, digits=2)%> <%=attr(dt, "units")%>.
