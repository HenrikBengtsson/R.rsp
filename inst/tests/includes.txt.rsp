This text file illustrates how to use the RSP 'include' preprocessing
directive to include contents from other sources.

This includes <%@include text="a piece"%> of text as is, which may
not be that exciting, but you can also include values of variable,
R options and system environment variables.  For instance, your
default paper size is set to '<%@include text="${papersize}"%>' in R.

It is also possible to include the contents of other files.
For instance, the file 'include.txt.rsp', contains:
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
<%@include file="include.txt" wrap="49"+%>
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

<%%@include file="time.txt.rsp"%%>

<%@include file="time.txt.rsp"%>
