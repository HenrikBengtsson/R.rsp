Package: R.rsp
==============

Version: 0.43.0 [2018-08-25]

BUG FIXES:

 * Forgot to declare a few S3 methods in the NAMESPACE.
 
DEPRECATED AND DEFUNCT:

 * Deprecated write() for RspResponse is now defunct - use writeResponse().


Version: 0.42.0 [2018-01-09]

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES:

 * Now importing 'digest' (used to be a suggested package).

BUG FIXES:

 * Package failed to install under _R_CHECK_DEPENDS_ONLY_=true and 'digest'
   not being installed. Now importing 'digest'.

DEPRECATED AND DEFUNCT:

 * Deprecated write() for RspResponse - use writeResponse() instead.

 * Replaced parse() with parseDocument(), parseCode(), parseDirectory(),
   and parseExpression().


Version: 0.41.0 [2017-04-15]

BUG FIXES:

 * WORKAROUND: If the generated RSP output contains invalid characters in the
   current encoding and is longer than 10,000 characters, it may result in an
   infinite loop of warnings generated by base::cat() (at least on Linux).
   This is now detected and writeBin() is used as fallback for outputting.
   For details, see R-devel thread
   https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-devel/2017-January/073571.html.

 * RspRSourceCodeFactory did not preserve '\unnnn' encoded UTF-8 characters
   (they where turned into "<U+NNNN>" strings).

 * rcode() would sometimes return NULL.

 * When used on *.html.rsp vignettes, vignette engine R.rsp::rsp would delete
   the generated *.html immediately after being produced.
 
DEPRECATED AND DEFUNCT:

  * Removed defunct methods that were part of the legacy API.
  
  * Attribute 'verbatim' for RSP 'include' preprocessing directives is defunct.
    Use attribute 'type' instead.


Version: 0.40.0 [2016-12-05]

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES:

 * All vignette formats now output a tangle file even if empty. For example, in
   the past *.asis and *.ltx vignettes would not generate *.R tangle files,
   whereas now they generate "empty" ones (R CMD build drops such "empty"
   tangle R files but that is a different story).  This was done in order to
   hotfix / workaround PR #17185
   (https://bugs.r-project.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=17185)

SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 * ROBUSTNESS: findAsciiDoc() and findPandoc() is more liberal when trying to
   infer and parse the version of the executable and if they still fail they
   give more informative error messages.

DEPRECATED AND DEFUNCT:

 * Deprecated RSP engine v0.1.0 is now defunct.

 * Made deprecated methods defunct.
 
 
Version: 0.30.0 [2016-05-15]

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES:

 * CLEANUP: Renamed exec/ script 'rsource(.bat)' to 'rcode(.bat)'.

SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 * WORKAROUND: knitr::pandoc() in knitr (>= 1.13) appends '_utf8' to output
   HTML filename (to the part before the extension). This caused one of the
   vignette engines to fail.  Now '_utf8' is dropped from the HTML filename
   if this is detected.

DEPRECATED AND DEFUNCT:

 * Deprecated several methods that was part of the old API, e.g. compileRsp(),
   sourceRsp(), translateRsp() etc.

 * Removed epsDev(), which has been defunct since R.rsp 0.19.7 (Jan 2015).

 * Workaround for markdown (<= 0.5.4) (Jan 2013) removed.


 
Version: 0.21.0 [2015-12-18]

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES:

 * Renamed rscript() to rcode().  rscript() is now deprecated.

NEW FEATURES:

 * Added vignette option %\VignetteCompression{} for alternative way of setting
   meta variable 'compression', e.g. %\VignetteCompression{gs(ebook)+qpdf} to
   compressed PDF output.

 * Added postprocessor for PDF compression, which can be enabled and controlled
   via meta variable 'compression', e.g. <%@meta compression="gs(ebook)"%>.

 * Setting meta variable 'postprocess' to FALSE can now be used to disable
   postprocessing, e.g. <%@meta postprocess="FALSE"%> in foo.md.rsp builds
   foo.md and does not continue compiling into an HTML document, which is
   otherwise the default.

SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 * ROBUSTNESS: findPandoc() could give an error if the pandoc executable failed
   for unpredictable reasons. Now it returns NULL if that is the case.  Same
   for findAsciidoc().

 * Explicit import of 'methods' functions.

BUG FIXES:

 * LEGACY CODE: Old RSP -> R script compiler could generate invalid R syntax
   for multiline RSP code expressions put in R source code comments.  Not sure
   why this all of a sudden shows up; maybe something changed in R that causes
   the bug to reveal itself.  This is old legacy code so the default / modern
   RSP engine is unaffected.

 * LEGACY CODE: While trying to generate an error, another error was thrown.

DEPRECATED AND DEFUNCT:

 * rscript() is now deprecated; use rcode() instead.


 
Version: 0.20.0 [2015-02-18]

SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 * ROBUSTNESS: Now compileLaTeX() will give an error if the filename extension
   is neither *.tex nor *.ltx (case sensitive).  The reason for this is that it
   is only those that are recognized by the underlying 'texi2dvi' script (if a
   different filename extension is used, 'texi2dvi' will use 'texinfo' instead
   of 'latex' to compile the document which for obvious reasons will not
   compile; texinfo files are not LaTeX files).  I'd like to thank Kurt Hornik
   at CRAN for helping me troubleshoot this as I incorrectly had a static
   LaTeX vignette named *.latex.
 
 
Version: 0.19.8 [2015-02-04]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Now all \VignetteKeyword{} entries inside a meta directives with language
   'R-vignette' are parsed into meta data field 'keywords'.

 * Added arguments 'header' and 'metadata' to compileMarkdown().

 * Now the processor function returned by findProcessor() passes meta data as
   a named list to the underlying compiler/processor.

 * Now the full RspFileProduct object is passed to postprocessors rather than
   its barebone pathname.
 
 
Version: 0.19.7 [2015-01-18]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Added Unix shell (and Windows batch) scripts 'rsource', 'rfile' and 'rcat'
   moved to system.file("exec", package = "R.rsp").  These scripts are convenient
   wrappers that use Rscript internally.

BUG FIXES:

 * isCapableOf() for "asciidoc" and "pandoc" would given an error (instead of
   FALSE) if the binary was not found.

DEPRECATED AND DEFUNCT:

 * CLEANUP: Defunct epsDev().

 
Version: 0.19.6 [2014-10-18]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Now the LaTeX processor returned by findProcess() for RspFileProduct (with
   content type application/x-tex or application/x-latex) will add the
   directory of the source file to the TEXINPUTS.

 * Added RSP preprocessing directives <%@ifdef ...%> and <%@ifndef ...%> which
   are shorts for <@if test="exists" ...%> and it's negated form.

SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 * ROBUSTNESS: Added more tests for the RSP language.

DEPRECATED AND DEFUNCT:

 * CLEANUP/ROBUSTNESS: As part of deprecating the old R.rsp (<= 0.8.2) API, the
   following steps have been taken:
   
   (a) S3 methods are no longer exported. Only the generics.
   
   (b) Methods flush() and stop() part of the old RSP API no longer mask
       corresponding functions of the 'base' package.
     
   (c) Several methods including those in the built-in Tcl httpd server no longer
       assumes that the R.rsp package is attached. They are also prepared for not
       all methods being exported (which may happen in a future release).
 
 
Version: 0.19.5 [2014-10-03]

NEW FEATURES:

 * The 'tex' and 'md' vignette engines no longer generates a tangle script.

DOCUMENTATION:

 * Added vignette 'R packages: LaTeX vignettes'.
 
 
Version: 0.19.4 [2014-09-03]

SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 * ROBUSTNESS: Now RSP preprocessing directive <%@if name="<name>" ...%> does a
   better jobs of locating RSP variables with a smaller risk of finding other
   R objects.
 
 
Version: 0.19.3 [2014-08-29]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Added Unix shell (and Windows batch) scripts 'rsource', 'rfile' and 'rcat'
   to system.file("bin", package = "R.rsp").  These scripts are convenient
   wrappers that use Rscript internally.

DOCUMENTATION:

 * Updated the 'Dynamic document creation using RSP' package vignette.

SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 * CLEANUP: Removed false R CMD check NOTEs recently introduced.

 * Bumped package dependencies.
 
 
Version: 0.19.2 [2014-07-02]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Added support for cut'n'paste and copy'n'paste preprocessing directives.
 
 
Version: 0.19.1 [2014-06-28]

NEW FEATURES:

 * GENERALIZATION: Now it is possible to use any symbol for enclosing attribute
   values in RSP directives in addition to the current x='y' and x="y" ones,
   e.g. x=.y., x=|y|, and so on.  Furthermore, paired brackets may also be
   used, e.g. x={y}, x=[y], x=<y> and x=(y), and then also in matched
   replicates, e.g. x={{{y}}}.  Added several package system tests for this.
 
 
Version: 0.19.0 [2014-06-07]

CODE REFACTORING:

 * Bumped version.
 
 
Version: 0.18.7 [2014-06-02]

BUG FIXES:

 * Trying to assign an empty string to an RSP preprocessing variable would not
   set the variable but return its current value or given an error if it did
   not exist, e.g.  <%@string empty=''%> could throw "No such variable
   ('empty')".  Added system test for this.
 
 
Version: 0.18.6 [2014-05-30]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Now rcompile() can write to file and if the input is a file, then it does
   so by default.
 
 
Version: 0.18.5 [2014-05-30]

NEW FEATURES:

 * RSP directives <%@meta ...%>, <%@string ...%>, ..., <%@integer ...%> gained
   attribute 'default' for getting their values.

 * Metadata field 'source' is now referring to the input RSP file by its
   absolute path, or URL, whenever known/possible.
 
 
Version: 0.18.4 [2014-05-30]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Vignette engine 'R.rsp::rsp' now respects %\VignetteTangle{FALSE}.

 * The R.rsp vignettes no longer produce tangle script, because they were not
   useful to anyone.

CODE REFACTORING:

 * Added 'Recommends' field to DESCRIPTION.
 
 
Version: 0.18.3 [2014-05-27]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Now rscript() can write to file and if the input is a file, then it does so
   by default.

 * Now metadata 'source', which is a reference to the source of the RSP
   document, is set whenever possible/known.  It is considered a "local"
   metadata attribute, meaning it will not be part of any generated source code
   scripts, because those should be the same regardless of where the source is
   located.

CODE REFACTORING:

 * Bumped up package dependencies.
 
 
Version: 0.18.2 [2014-05-24]

CODE REFACTORING:

 * Using R.utils::use() instead of require() in more places.

 * CLEANUP: Dropped internal ununsed vignette engines.

 * Bumped up package dependencies.

 
Version: 0.18.1 [2014-05-17]

NEW FEATURES:

 * USABILITY: The error messages thrown on RSP code chunks with syntax errors
   now also display the beginning and the end of the actual code chunk making
   it easier to identify/locate it.

 * CLEANUP: Now rspWeave() and hence the 'rsp::rsp' vignette engine cleans up
   intermediate files (e.g. Markdown and TeX) produced while compiling the
   vignette into its final output (HTML or PDF).

CODE REFACTORING:

 * Now using withCapture() in vignettes replacing alias evalCapture().

 * Bumped up package dependencies.

 
Version: 0.18.0 [2014-05-07]

CODE REFACTORING:

 * CLEANUP: R.oo package is no longer attached when attaching this package.
 
 
Version: 0.17.3 [2014-05-05]

NEW FEATURES:

 * rfile() now assumes an RSP document when it cannot infer the type from the
   filename etc.
 
 
Version: 0.17.2 [2014-05-02]

CODE REFACTORING:

 * Using R.utils::use() instead of library() in more RSP documents.
 
DEPRECATED AND DEFUNCT:

 * CLEANUP: Removed evalWithEcho(), which has been deprecated since 2011.

 
Version: 0.17.1 [2014-04-30]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Added vignette engine 'R.rsp::asis' to include static PDFs and HTMLs.

DOCUMENTATION:

 * Restructured and updated the R.rsp vignettes.
 
 
Version: 0.17.0 [2014-04-29]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Now suggested packages are installed automagically, iff needed. This
   minimizes the need for preinstalling packages whenever using R.rsp to
   compile documents.
 
 
Version: 0.16.0 [2014-04-18]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Now all rfile() also works with URLs for all known processors, e.g.
   rfile("http://latex-project.org/guides/usrguide.tex") and
   rfile("https://raw.github.com/yihui/knitr-examples/master/001-minimal.Rmd").
   Added package system tests for various types of "online" compilation.

 * Now rspTangle() passes '...' to rsource().

BUG FIXES:

 * RspFileProduct would corrupt URLs.
 
 
Version: 0.15.2 [2014-04-06]

SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 * ROBUSTNESS: Now compileLaTeX() cleans up and shortens LaTeX environment
   variables (e.g. TEXINPUTS) iff possible, before compiling the document.
   This lowers the risk for compilation failures due to too long search paths.
 
 
Version: 0.15.1 [2014-03-24]

SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 * ROBUSTNESS: Now compileLaTeX() tries to shorten any paths as far as
   possible, e.g. ../foo/../foo/ to ../foo/ to workaround possible length
   limits of the TeX compiler.  It now also adds a symbolic link to TEXINPUTS
   that refers to the directory of the LaTeX file.

BUG FIXES:

 * WORKAROUND: On Windows, due to limitations in browseURL(..., browser = NULL),
   which in turn utilizes shell.exec(), view() for RspFileProduct failed to
   open files in subdirectories, because they had forward slashes in their
   pathname, e.g. reports/main.html.  By temporarily changing the working
   directory to that of the file, view() now opens the file properly.
 
 
Version: 0.15.0 [2014-02-25]

SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 * ROBUSTNESS: Now the package runs the garbage collector if unloaded in order
   to make sure finalize() is called on any deleted HttpDaemon objects.

CODE REFACTORING:

 * Bumped up package dependencies.
 
 
Version: 0.14.1 [2014-02-07]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Now print() for RspFileProduct reports file sizes also in kB, MB, etc.
 
 
Version: 0.14.0 [2014-02-04]

NEW FEATURES:

 * SPEEDUP: Significant speed up of methods such as rstring() and rfile() for
   RSP expression that outputted a large amount of text to the output document.
   Internally, this was achieved by replacing the default capturing of output,
   which uses text connections, with one that uses raw connections instead.
   The processing time for the former was exponential in the number of captured
   lines whereas for the latter it is linear.
 
 
Version: 0.13.0 [2014-01-27]

NEW FEATURES:

 * It's possible to call rcat(), rfile() etc. from the command line with
   arguments, e.g. Rscript -e R.rsp::rfile LoremIpsum.md.rsp and
   Rscript -e R.rsp::rcat "Random number: <%= sample(1) %>".  Also, by setting
   'alias rcat = Rscript -e R.rsp::rcat' etc one can then just call
   'rcat "Random number: <%= sample(1) %>"'.
 
 
Version: 0.12.9 [2014-01-26]

 * CLEANUP: Internal calls to R.oo::ll() used really only by verbose statements
   trigger the attachment of the R.oo package (as of R.oo (>= 1.17.0)), which
   in turn outputs a few package startup messages.  Thus calling, say,
   R.rsp::rcat() would output such messages (which would be surprising to the
   user).  To lower this impact, ll() is only called when verbose is enabled.
 
 
Version: 0.12.8 [2014-01-17]

SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 * ROBUSTNESS: Added package system tests asserting that the output of the RSP
   parser can be deparsed and when reparsed the output will be identical.
 
 
Version: 0.12.7 [2014-01-13]

SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 * ROBUSTNESS: Now compileLaTeX() adds the directory of the LaTeX file to
   TEXINPUTS also by its relative path (in addition to its absolute path).
   This provides a workaround for systems that does not handle TEXINPUTS
   paths that are too long.
 
 
Version: 0.12.6 [2014-01-11]

BUG FIXES:

 * RSP comments with only a single character commented out would generate an
   RSP parsing error, e.g. '<%-- --%>' and '<%--\n--%>'.  Added package system
   tests for more comment cases, including these.
 
 
Version: 0.12.5 [2014-01-05]

CODE REFACTORING:

 * CLEANUP: Removed code that is now in R.oo (>= 1.16.2).
 
 
Version: 0.12.4 [2014-01-02]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Added rstring(), rcat(), rfile() and rsource() for expression:s too.
 
 
Version: 0.12.3 [2013-12-21]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Now rfile() also supports filename substitution based on whisker /
   Mustache-like variable substitution, i.e. {{<variable>}}.
 
 
Version: 0.12.2 [2013-12-15]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Added !() for RspProduct, which is a shortcut for view().
 
 * Now the code generated by RspRSourceCodeFactory provides a rmeta()
   function for getting and setting document metadata.

 
Version: 0.12.1 [2013-12-14]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Now rfile() accepts also non-RSP documents, e.g. rfile("report.md"),
   rfile("report.Rnw"), and rfile("report.tex").  This also means that all RSP
   documents must use the *.rsp filename extension in order for rfile() to
   automatically recognize it as RSP.  To process files with custom extensions
   as RSP, do rfile(RspFileProduct("report.custom", type = "application/x-rsp")).

 * Now getType() for RspFileProduct works also for URLs.

BUG FIXES:

 * compileRsp() did not acknowledge argument 'postprocess'.
 
 
Version: 0.12.0 [2013-12-13]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Now rfile() tries to rename the generated output file, iff its filename can
   be renamed using variable substitutions.  For instance,
   rfile('${foo}.txt.rsp') will try to rename output file '${foo}.txt' to
   'SampleA.txt', if variable 'foo' is set to say 'SampleA' (either globally or
   by the RSP document).  If the variable is not set, the output file will
   remain '${foo}.txt'.  Requires R.utils (>= 1.28.6).

BUG FIXES:

 * compileRsp(..., postprocess = TRUE) would throw 'Error in UseMethod("process"):
   no applicable method for 'process' applied to an object of class
   "character"'.  Added system test for compileRsp().
 
 
Version: 0.11.0 [2013-12-12]

NEW FEATURES:

 * SIMPLIFICATION: Now the registered 'rsp::rsp' engine postprocesses the RSP
   document by default.  This means that RSP-embedded Markdown vignettes will
   be turned into HTML documents just as RSP-embedded LaTeX vignettes will
   become PDF documents.  It also means that such engines will no longer rely
   on the R 'tools' package to compile TeX output into PDFs.
 
 
Version: 0.10.3 [2013-12-06]

CODE REFACTORING:

 * CLEANUP: Dropped obsolete autoload():s.
 
 
Version: 0.10.2 [2013-11-23]

BUG FIXES:

 * rsource() would not evaluate in the current environment.  Added a package
   system test for this.
 
 
Version: 0.10.1 [2013-11-18]

DOCUMENTATION:

 * Added a small LoremIpsum.tex.rsp example vignette that is also useful as a
   stub for others to build upon.
 
 
Version: 0.10.0 [2013-11-03]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Now "child" RSP documents imported into a "parent" RSP document via
   <%@import ...%>, sees all meta data of the parent, and any meta data set by
   the child document are also set in the parent one.  Updated main vignette
   to mention this.  Added a system tests.

BUG FIXES:

 * setMetadata(..., metadata = list()) would give an error.
 
 
Version: 0.9.30 [2013-11-03]

NEW FEATURES:

 * CLEANUP: Now the 'md.rsp+knitr:pandoc' vignette engine suppresses messages
   generated by knitr::pandoc().
 
 
Version: 0.9.29 [2013-10-17]

BUG FIXES:

 * The browseRsp() demo page assumed that 'R.utils' was attached.
 
 
Version: 0.9.28 [2013-10-14]

DOCUMENTATION:

 * Updates to vignettes: Added rsource() command to 'RSP Markup Language -
   Reference Card' vignette'.  Adjusted the other two vignettes to reflect
   usage of vignettes/.

CODE REFACTORING:

 * Now the package vignettes are in vignettes/ and no longer in inst/doc/,
   which will not be supported by R (>= 3.1.0).

 * Now package only imports explicitly what is needed from dependent packages.

BUG FIXES:

 * If an RspEvalDirective for language="R" had a parse or an evaluation
   error, the intended error message was not generated because it in turn
   would give another error.

 * Vignette 'RSP-refcard.tex.rsp' assumed that the 'R.rsp' package was
   attached, which it may not be in all cases.


 
Version: 0.9.27 [2013-10-13]

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES:

 * GENERALIZATION: Updated the framework for building non-Sweave vignettes also
   under R (< 3.0.0) to support the vignettes/ directory in addition to
   inst/doc/.  Thanks to Jari Oksanen,  University of Oulu, Finland, for the
   pointers on how to do this.
 
 
Version: 0.9.26 [2013-09-28]

NEW FEATURES:

 * No isCapableOf() also supports version specifications.

 * Now the 'R.rsp' Package object is also available when the package is only
   loaded (but not attached).

CODE REFACTORING:

 * Bumped up package dependencies.

BUG FIXES:

 * The 'Dynamic document creation using RSP' vignette assumed that
   evalCapture() of 'R.utils' was on the search path.

 * ROBUSTNESS: Now the 'Introductory slides on RSP' vignette better detects
   what version of 'pandoc' is available and adapts accordingly.  If not
   available, the fallback Markdown version will display a note about this.
   Thanks to Brian Ripley for reporting on 'pandoc' version incompatibilities.
 
 
Version: 0.9.25 [2013-09-19]

SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 * Changed how vignette engines are registered so that if an error occurs, it
   is no longer silently ignored.

 * ROBUSTNESS: Forgot to import R.methodsS3::appendVarArgs().
 
 
Version: 0.9.24 [2013-09-18]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Now preprocess() of RspDocument also records R vignette meta data 'engine'
   (from %\VignetteEngine{}) and RSP custom 'tangle' (from %\VignetteTangle{}).

DOCUMENTATION:

 * Updated the 'Dynamic document creation using RSP' vignette with information
   on how to embedded image files as data URI into HTML and Markdown.

 * Added HTML vignette 'Introductory slides on RSP'. This requires that the
   package suggests the 'R.devices', 'base64enc' and 'knitr' packages.

SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 * ROBUSTNESS: Now start() for HttpDaemon makes sure that the R.rsp package is
   attached so that the Tcl HTTP daemon have access to its methods.

CODE REFACTORING:

 * Bumped up package dependencies.
 
BUG FIXES:
 
 * WORKAROUND: For now, package attaches the 'R.oo' package.  This is needed
   due to what appears to be a bug in how R.oo finalizes Object:s assuming R.oo
   is/can be attached.  Until that is resolved, we make sure R.oo is attached.

 * Two of the package vignettes assumed that the 'R.rsp' package would be
   attached.
 
 
Version: 0.9.23 [2013-09-16]

SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 * ROBUSTNESS: Package no longer assumes that R.utils is attached.

 * ROBUSTNESS: Now the package also works when only loaded.

CODE REFACTORING:

 * ROBUSTNESS: Now all S3 methods are formally declared in NAMESPACE.

 * Bumped up package dependencies.
 
 
Version: 0.9.22 [2013-09-10]

CODE REFACTORING:

 * CLEANUP: Package no longer utilizes ':::'.
 
 
Version: 0.9.21 [2013-08-20]

CODE REFACTORING:

 * Package no longer attaches ("loads") R.utils, only imports it.
 
 
Version: 0.9.20 [2013-08-05]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Added rsource() which is for RSP files what source() is for R files.
 
 
Version: 0.9.19 [2013-08-04]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Added argument 'buffered' to rcat().  If FALSE and output is sent to
   standard output, then RSP output is forwarded to standard output as they
   appear (and the underlying engine allow for it).

CODE REFACTORING:

 * Bumped up package dependencies.
 
 
Version: 0.9.18 [2013-07-29]

DOCUMENTATION:

 * The 'RSP Markup Language - Reference Card' vignette was slightly too long
   causing it to have a second pages.

BUG FIXES:

 * tidy() for RspRSourceCode would not drop the last line of the header leaving
   a long '## - - - - ...' comment line at top.
 
 
Version: 0.9.17 [2013-07-28]

CODE REFACTORING:

 * CLEANUP: Dropped tempvar() now in R.utils v1.26.0.
 
 
Version: 0.9.16 [2013-07-26]

NEW FEATURES:

 * GENERALIZATION: Now all return values are processed via generic function
   rpaste() before being outputted via cat().  This makes it possible (i) to
   override the default and (ii) to define class specific behaviors from
   within the RSP document itself.
 
 
Version: 0.9.15 [2013-07-19]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Added capabilitiesOf(R.rsp) for easy summary of what tools are supported on
   the current system.  It is also possible to check support for a particular
   tool, e.g. isCapableOf(R.rsp, "latex").

DOCUMENTATION:

 * Rewrote the package description.

CODE REFACTORING:

 * CLEANUP: Removed internal archive of old Tcl HTTP daemons.
 
 
Version: 0.9.14 [2013-07-18]

BUG FIXES:

 * rstring(), rcat(), and rfile() on template function:s would only work if the
   evaluation was done in the default environment.  Added system tests for this.
 
 
Version: 0.9.13 [2013-07-17]

CODE REFACTORING:

 * Internal code cleanup.

BUG FIXES:

 * The automatic adding of a TEXINPUTS directory done by compileLaTeX() needed
   to add its absolute (not relative) path.
 
 
Version: 0.9.12 [2013-07-17]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Now it possible to pass argument 'clean' all the way down to compileLaTeX()
   via rfile(), e.g. rfile("foo.tex.rsp", clean = TRUE).
 
 
Version: 0.9.11 [2013-07-16]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Added rstring(), rcat() and rfile() for (template) function:s.

SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 * ROBUSTNESS: Updated system tests to not use commas in LaTeX file paths,
   because such are not supported on all file systems.

 * ROBUSTNESS: If compileLaTeX() was called on a LaTeX file in a directory
   different than the working directory, it could fail to located files to be
   included (e.g. image files).  In order to make this less likely to happen,
   compileLaTeX() now adds the the directory of the compiled LaTeX file to the
   TEXINPUTS search path, iff it is different than the working directory.
 
 
Version: 0.9.10 [2013-07-14]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Added rfile() also for RspString, RspDocument and RspRSourceCode.

BUG FIXES:

 * evaluate() for RspRSourceCode failed to evaluate in to proper environment
   if the default (parent) environment was used.
 
 
Version: 0.9.9 [2013-07-12]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Updated the template vignette Makefile that is needed prior to R v3.0.0 to
   no remove LaTeX files needed by R CMD check. These should instead be handled
   by .Rinstignore (a template for this is also available).

DOCUMENTATION:

 * Updated the vignettes.
 
 
Version: 0.9.8 [2013-07-04]

SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 * ROBUSTNESS: Added more tests on preprocessing.

CODE REFACTORING:

 * Internal code cleanup.

 * Bumped up package dependencies.
 
 
Version: 0.9.7 [2013-05-25]

CODE REFACTORING:

 * Minor speedup by replacing rm() calls with NULL assignments.
 
 
Version: 0.9.6 [2013-05-23]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Several updates to browseRsp():
 
   (a) It automatically adds the current directory ('.') as well as a './rsp'
       subdirectory to the list of known root paths.
     
   (b) R.rsp::browseRsp() works without loading the package first.
   
   (c) It can be used to open any RSP file by specifying it's (absolute or
       relative) pathname, e.g. browseRsp("foo/bar.html.rsp") and
       browseRsp("foo/bar.md.rsp").

 * Added argument 'trim=FALSE' to getParameter() and getParameters() for
   HttpRequest.

CODE REFACTORING:

 * Now processRsp() for HttpDaemon with version="1.0.0" utilizes rfile() rather
   than rstring() so that postprocessors are also applied.  Also, the rfile()
   working directory is set to the current directory (and not the directory of
   the source file as with version = "0.1.0").  For backward compatibility with
   old RSP pages, write() for HttpDaemonRspResponse now supports the new RSP
   engine as well.  This will simplify the transition.
 
SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 * ROBUSTNESS: Now rfile() handles files with only one filename extension.

 
Version: 0.9.5 [2013-05-20]

CODE REFACTORING:

 * CRAN POLICY: Now all Rd \usage{} lines are at most 90 characters long.

 * CRAN POLICY: Now all Rd example lines are at most 100 characters long.
 
 
Version: 0.9.4 [2013-05-18]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Now empty lines in .rspPlugins are ignored.

DOCUMENTATION:

 * Now vignettes are properly using opened and closed quotation marks.  Thanks
   Saunak Sen at UCSF for reporting on this.
 
 
Version: 0.9.3 [2013-05-08]

DOCUMENTATION:

 * Explicitly added arguments 'file' & 'path' to rcat() to make the help page
   more user friendly [although they're just passed as is to rstring()].
 
 
Version: 0.9.2 [2013-04-04]

CODE REFACTORING:

 * The internal RSP engine has undergone a major redesign.

 * BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY: The RSP processor of the built-in HTTP daemon is by
   default still using the previous RSP engine.  Note, the built-in HTTP daemon
   is only there as a proof of concept and is not recommended for other than
   toy examples.
 
 
Version: 0.9.1 [2013-04-01]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Whenever only a URL directory is requested, the built-in HTTP daemon now
   loads the first file matching "^index[.](html|.*)$".  It used to only look
   for 'index.rsp'.

CODE REFACTORING:

 * The internal RSP engine is undergoing a major redesign.
 
 
Version: 0.9.0 [2013-03-01]

NEW FEATURES:

 * More functions can now be called without loading the package.

 * Simplified how to build non-Sweave vignettes for R (< 3.0.0).  It now
   imitates how it is done in R (>= 3.0.0).

DOCUMENTATION:

 * Updated the help usage section for all static methods.

CODE REFACTORING:

 * Prepared package for the upcoming R (>= 3.0.0) generic vignette support.

 
Version: 0.8.5 [2013-01-20]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Added compileRnw() which compiles Sweave and knitr Rnw files.

 * Added typeOfRnw() which tries to infer whether an Rnw file is for Sweave or
   knitr based on its contents.

SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 * ROBUSTNESS: Added system tests for compileKnitr(), compileRnw() and rsp()
   for handling Sweave and knitr Rnw files.

CODE REFACTORING:

 * Now rsp() uses compileRnw() for *.Rnw files.

 * Added 'knitr' under suggested packages.

 
Version: 0.8.4 [2012-12-19]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Utilizing new startupMessage() of R.oo.
 
 
Version: 0.8.3 [2012-12-06]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Added argument 'outPath' to compileLaTeX(), compileSweave() and rsp(), which
   is also the working directory.

SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 * Added system tests for compileLaTeX(), compileSweave() and rsp().

BUG FIXES:

 * compileLaTeX() and compileSweave() would return an incorrect pathname unless
   the source file was in the working directory.
 
 
Version: 0.8.2 [2012-06-22]

SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 * ROBUSTNESS: Now the doc/Makefile no longer assumes 'R' is on the system's
   search path.  Instead it uses $(R_HOME)/bin/R. Thanks to Kasper Hansen
   at John Hopkins for the suggestion.
 
 
Version: 0.8.1 [2012-06-16]

CODE REFACTORING:

 * Now package only imports R.methodsS3 and R.oo instead of "depends" on them.
 
 
Version: 0.8.0 [2012-05-02]

CODE REFACTORING:

 * Now the package depends on R.devices, which contains the utility functions
   for graphical devices that originate from R.utils.
 
 
Version: 0.7.5 [2012-03-20]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Now inst/doc/templates/Makefile does a better job cleaning up.
 
 
Version: 0.7.4 [2012-03-06]

CODE REFACTORING:

 * CRAN POLICY: Removed all internal copies of 'base' functions that contain
   .Internal().
 
 
Version: 0.7.3 [2012-02-28]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Added toLatex() for LaTeX escaping character strings, cf. utils::toLatex()
   for 'sessionInfo' objects.
 
 
Version: 0.7.2 [2012-01-21]

CODE REFACTORING:

 * Placed a copy of inst/doc/Makefile in inst/doc/templates/ and updated the
   'Include static PDFs and non-Sweave vignettes in an R package' vignette
   accordingly.  The reason for this change is that inst/doc/Makefile will not
   be installed in recent version of R.  The Makefile also does a better job
   cleaning up.
 
 
Version: 0.7.1 [2011-11-28]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Now R.rsp::rsp() can be called without the package had been loaded before.
 
 
Version: 0.7.0 [2011-11-23]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Now the building of vignettes is independent of R.rsp.  All that is needed
   to build non-Sweave vignettes (via RSP, brew etc), or include a static PDF,
   is to have a corresponding *.Rnw stub with custom vignette options
   \VignetteSource{} and \VignetteBuild{}. See inst/doc/ of this package for
   more details.

DOCUMENTATION:

 * Added a vignette explaining how to include static PDFs and non-Sweave
   vignettes in an R package.

 * CLEANUP: Dropped an old vignette from 2006.


Version: 0.6.11 [2011-11-22]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Now the *.tex.rsp vignettes are recognized by R.  This was done by tricking
   R to believe they are of Sweave origin.
 
 
Version: 0.6.10 [2011-11-17]

SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 * ROBUSTNESS: Now the generated R script adds 'write <- R.rsp::write' at the
   beginning, to assure that it is used instead of base::write().
 
 
Version: 0.6.9 [2011-11-14]

SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 * ROBUSTNESS: Now <%= [expr] %> is translated with curly brackets around the
   expression, i.e. write(response, {[expr]}).  This allows for writing
   <%= x <- 1; x^2 %> instead of <%={ x <- 1; x^2 }%>.

BUG FIXES:

 * By default the RSP document would be evaluated in the local call frame of
   rsp(), not its parent frame.
 
 
Version: 0.6.8 [2011-11-07]

CODE REFACTORING:

 * CLEANUP: Replaced an internal evalWithEcho() with evalCapture().

BUG FIXES:

 * Although deprecated, the update to evalWithEcho() did not work.
 
 
Version: 0.6.7 [2011-11-06]

CODE REFACTORING:

 * Updated code and vignettes to utilize evalCapture() of R.utils v1.9.2.

 * CLEANUP: Dropped the old 'The R.rsp package v0.3.0' vignette.

DEPRECATED AND DEFUNCT:

 * DEPRECATED: evalWithEcho(); use evalCapture() instead.

 
Version: 0.6.6 [2011-11-05]

CODE REFACTORING:

 * Updated the R.rsp vignette to utilize toPNG() of R.utils v1.9.1.
 
 
Version: 0.6.5 [2011-11-01]

BUG FIX:

 * The package would not load in R v2.15.0 devel, because it tried to access
   restart(), which has been dropped.  This was a non-critical error and the
   fix was trivial.
 
 
Version: 0.6.4 [2011-10-21]

DOCUMENTATION:

 * Updated the package's DESCRIPTION with an example of the RSP syntax.
 
 
Version: 0.6.3 [2011-09-21]

DOCUMENTATION:

 * RSP PAGES: Added clarifications to the main index.rsp page.
 
BUG FIXES:

 * HttpDaemon$getRootPaths() did not handle paths with spaces correctly. Added
   a getRootPaths() Tcl function to instead handle this, which is called by the
   former.
 
 
Version: 0.6.2 [2011-07-27]

DOCUMENTATION:

 * CLEANUP: Replaced all references to 'R Server Pages' with RSP.

 * RSP PAGES: Minor cleanup and harmonization.
 
 
Version: 0.6.1 [2011-07-24]

CODE REFACTORING:

 * Now package exports '.conflicts.OK' in order to avoid several warnings when
   loading package.
 
 
Version: 0.6.0 [2011-07-23]

SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 * Added a namespace to the package, which will be more or less a requirement
   in the next major release of R.
 
 
Version: 0.5.4 [2011-05-05]

CODE REFACTORING:

 * ROBUSTNESS: Internal sourceWithTrim() no longer uses partial argument when
   calling source().
 
 
Version: 0.5.3 [2011-04-19]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Added arguments 'clean' and 'quiet' to compileLaTeX().
 
 
Version: 0.5.2 [2011-04-18]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Now browseRsp() pass '...' arguments to browseURL().

DOCUMENTATION:

 * Updated 'Dynamic LaTeX reports with RSP' vignette.
 
 
Version: 0.5.1 [2011-04-16]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Now docs/Makefile cleans out all auxiliary files.

BUG FIXES:

 * On R v2.12.x, rsp(text = "...") would throw 'Error ...: unused
   argument(s) (fileext = ".txt.rsp")'.  Solved by providing a patched
   tempfile() with this feature for R v2.12.x.  Thanks Uwe Ligges for
   spotting this.
 
 
Version: 0.5.0 [2011-04-14]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Added rsp().

 * Added compileLaTeX() and compileSweave().

 * Changed RSP preprocess directives to have format <%#insert ...%>.

DOCUMENTATION:

 * Updated 'Dynamic LaTeX reports with RSP' vignette.

 * Cleaned up the help pages.
 
 
Version: 0.4.10 [2011-04-06]

NEW FEATURES:

 * RSP PAGES: Now the 'R Server Pages' page launched by browseRsp() list only
   the first package installation in case a package occurs in multiple package
   libraries in .libPaths().

 * RSP PAGES: Added a demo page listing all built-in colors in R.

 
Version: 0.4.9 [2011-04-04]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Added support for RSP preprocessing directive <%@insert ...%>.
 
 
Version: 0.4.8 [2011-03-31]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Now parseRsp() drops RSP comments, i.e. '<%-- {anything} --%>'.

 * Rewrote evalWithEcho() so that it utilizes source(..., echo = TRUE).

 * Now the RSP documentation is automatically generated when the package is built.
 
DOCUMENTATION:

 * Additional updates on the 'Dynamic LaTeX reports with RSP' vignette.

 
Version: 0.4.7 [2011-03-28]

DOCUMENTATION:

 * Additional updates on the 'Dynamic LaTeX reports with RSP' vignette.

BUG FIXES:

 * write() for RspResponse classes would ignore arguments 'collapse' and 'sep'.
 
 
Version: 0.4.6 [2011-03-12]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Now the trimming of RSP handles all newline types, i.e. LF, CR+LF, and CR.
   The corresponding argument 'trimRsp' now defaults to TRUE everywhere.

 * CLEANUP: Some minor R code cleanups.

BUG FIXES:

 * The main 'R Server Pages' page launched by browseRsp() would list package
   twice on a Windows system.
 
 
Version: 0.4.5 [2011-03-08]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Updated getParameter() of HttpRequest to return all values of a query
   parameter with multiple entries.  Added argument 'drop'.

BUG FIXES:

 * getHttpRequest() of HttpDaemon would drop all but the last of replicated
   query parameters of the same name, which for instance may occur if an HTML
   form with replicated check boxes is used. Thanks to Truc Trung at
   University of Bergen, Norway, for this report.
 
 
Version: 0.4.4 [2011-03-08]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Now rsptex() trims white space of RSP blocks so that RSP-only blocks no
   longer introduces newlines (that previously had to be escaped).

 * Added argument 'trimRsp' to parseRsp() for trimming white spaces surrounding
   RSP blocks that have preceding and succeeding white space and that are
   followed by a newline.  Currently it defaults to FALSE, but this may change
   in a future release.  The same was added to old translateRspV1() for
   compatibility reasons.  Note, compileRsp() and sourceRsp() will pass this
   argument down to these functions via '...'.
 
 
Version: 0.4.3 [2011-02-20]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Now argument 'pdf' of rsptex() default to TRUE.

DOCUMENTATION:

 * Added example(rsptex).

 * First draft of a article on how to generate dynamic reports by extending
   LaTeX with RSP.
 
 
Version: 0.4.2 [2011-02-14]

DOCUMENTATION:

 * Added a section to help(rsptex) explaining in what environment the RSP
   document is evaluated and how to retrieve it and its content.

BUG FIXES:

 * parseRsp() would generate invalid R code/R comments for multiline
   <%= ... %> statements.
 
 
Version: 0.4.1 [2011-01-06]

DOCUMENTATION:

 * Clarified in the help of HttpDaemon that it is only connections from the
   local host (127.0.0.1) that are accepted.  This lowers the risk for
   unauthorized access to the R session.
 
 
Version: 0.4.0 [2010-09-15]

BUG FIXES:

 * browseRsp(path = "/R/settings/options.rsp") and
   browseRsp(path = "/R/settings/par.rsp") was throwing "Error in
   help("par", pager = stdoutPager): unused argument(s)
   (pager = stdoutPager)" in R >= 2.10.0.
 
 
Version: 0.3.7 [2010-08-04]

BUG FIXES:

 * browseRsp(path = "/R/system/packages.rsp") would throw "Error in eval(expr,
   envir, enclos): subscript out of bounds".
 
 
Version: 0.3.6 [2009-09-16]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Updated the HTTP header generated by the built-in webserver from
   'HTTP/1.x [...]' to 'HTTP/1.1 [...]'.  Thanks Ryan Bressler (Institute for
   Systems Biology, Seattle) for reporting this.
 
 
Version: 0.3.5 [2009-02-23]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Added rsptex() to compiling a *.tex.rsp file into a *.dvi file via
   *.tex.rsp -> *.tex.rsp.R -> *.tex -> *.dvi.

 * Added compileRsp(), which utilizes internal translateRsp() which in turn
   calls parseRsp().

DEPRECATED AND DEFUNCT:

 * Renamed old translateRsp() to translateRspV1(), which sourceRsp() is still
   utilizing.
 
 
Version: 0.3.4 [2008-03-06]

BUG FIXES:

 * Regular expression pattern 'a-Z' is illegal on (at least) some locale, e.g.
   'C' (where 'A-z' works). The only way to specify the ASCII alphabet is to
   list all characters explicitly, which we now do in all methods of the
   package.  See the r-devel thread "invalid regular expression '[a-Z]'" on
   2008-03-05 for details.
 
 
Version: 0.3.3 [2007-06-10]

SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 * Updated code such that package pass R CMD check R v2.6.0.

BUG FIXES:

 * Removed obsolete code calling non-existing functions.
 
 
Version: 0.3.2 [2007-04-07]

BUG FIXES:

 * Replaced gsub pattern "\\\[\"\']" with "\\\\[\"\']" in indexOfNonQuoted().

 * Replace regexpr pattern "^[ \]*=[ \]*" with "^[ \]*=[ \]*" in translateRsp().
 
 
Version: 0.3.1 [2007-01-07]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Added rspToHtml() in order to simplify RSP-to-HTML compilations.
 
 
Version: 0.3.0 [2006-07-20]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Packages with an rsp/ path (installed from inst/rsp/) will now be listed and
   linked to on the main RSP page.  This makes it very easy to add RSP pages to
   a package.  For an example, see the aroma.light package.

 * Added browseRsp() for the Package too, e.g. browseRsp(aroma.light).  Added
   help pages for these methods.

 * When calling browseRsp(start = TRUE), (the parents of) all library paths are
   now added to the root paths.

SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 * Package has now been verified to compile not only HTML input files, but also
   TeX files.  This make RSP a very power tool to write vignettes.  Added a
   simple package vignette.

BUG FIXES:

 * translateRsp("\\\n") would convert to "\\n". Thanks Peter Dahlsgaard for the
   suggestion how to fix it using deparse().

 * translateRsp() would replicate last R code or text piece, for each RSP
   comment tag.
 
 
Version: 0.2.9 [2006-07-05]

BUG FIXES:

 * If argument 'path' was NULL, translateRsp() gave an error. Thanks Julien
   Gagneur for pointing this out.
 
 
Version: 0.2.8 [2006-07-04]

CODE REFACTORING:

 * Renamed class Response to RspResponse and RspResponse to FileRspResponse,
   cf. HttpDaemonRspResponse.

 * Now sourceRsp() creates an HttpRequest object internally, if not given.
   Added an example to ?sourceRsp too.

DOCUMENTATION:

 * Added a little bit more help text.
 
 
Version: 0.2.7 [2006-06-13]

BUG FIXES:

 * Used obsolete setClassS3() instead of setConstructorS3().
 
 
Version: 0.2.6 [2006-02-22]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Added getParameters() to HttpRequest for completeness.

BUG FIX:

 * The RSP page on "System Details" used functions only available on Windows
   platforms.

BUG FIXES:

 * HttpDaemon$getHttpRequest() failed to retrieve
   parameters with empty values, e.g. "index.rsp?foo=&bar=2".
 
 
Version: 0.2.5 [2006-01-21]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Added writeResponse() to HttpDaemon.  No other classes but HttpDaemon should
   know about the Tcl HTTP daemon.

 * Improved the built-in RSP pages.

KNOWN ISSUES:

 * Mozilla browsers does unfortunately not follow file URLs (file://) when
   clicking on links on a page that has been loaded via HTTP. This makes it
   impossible (for now) to link to local R help pages via RSP pages (without
   passing everything through the HTTP daemon that is). It works under
   Internet Explorer.

DOCUMENTATION:

 * Added more help.
 
 
Version: 0.2.4 [2006-01-11]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Create better support for plugins on the main RSP page.

 * Added argument 'overwrite' to sourceAllRsp().

 * Added argument 'overwrite' to constructor of RspResponse.

DOCUMENTATION:

 * Updated example(HttpDaemon) so it actually runs and opens up the main RSP
   page (when in interactive mode).

BUG FIXES:

 * translateRsp() would in some locales give the error:  simpleError in
   gsub(pattern, replacement, x, ignore.case,  extended, fixed): 'replacement'
   is invalid in this locale This was due to an incorrect internal MAGIC.STRING.
   Thanks Julien Gagneur at EMBL/HTFG Center, Heidelberg for this bug fix.

 
Version: 0.2.3 [2005-10-27]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Removed the generation of doc/ from rsp files. Now all such documentation
   is supposed to viewed via the built in HTTP daemon.  This might change
   if/when a root ServletRequest class is written.
 
 
Version: 0.2.2 [2005-10-20]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Now root paths can be set before the server has started.

 * Updated the Tcl HTTP daemon so it can search multiple root directories for
   files to be processed.

 * Update the RSP pages to include a common header with a navigator. Changes
   the CSS style to use sans serif etc.
 
BUG FIXES:

 * HttpDaemon$startHelp() tried to open the wrong page.

 
Version: 0.2.1 [2005-10-15]

BUG FIXES:

 * The HttpDaemon sent the wrong MIME type for *.rsp pages. Now text/html as it
   should be.
 
 
Version: 0.2.0 [2005-09-26]

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES:

 * Added a simple webserver (HTTP Daemon) requiring Tcl, which now all R
   installation has.  The current version recognized and pre-process RSP files.

BUG FIXES:

 * sourceRsp() is no longer using argument 'output', but 'response'.
 
 
Version: 0.1.3 [2005-09-18]

NEW FEATURES:

 * The RSP template is now searching for a functional PNG device.

CODE REFACTORING:

 * Made a few method protected (and hence hid their documentation), because
   they are not of public interest.

DOCUMENTATION:

 * Added help to all methods.  R CMD check gives no warnings.
 
 
Version: 0.1.2 [2005-08-15]

NEW FEATURES:

 * All output is first interpreted as a GString before being written.

 * Added support for page directive with attribute 'import'.

SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 * More robust search for '%>'; tries to make sure the ending tag is not within
   a character string.
 
 
Version: 0.1.1 [2005-08-02]

NEW FEATURES:

 * If an error occurs with an RSP file when running sourceAllRsp(), it smoothly
   continues with the next file instead of interrupting.

DOCUMENTATION:

 * Clean up and added help pages to all methods and classes.

 * Now the "User Guides and Package Vignettes" documentation is build from RSP
   files when re-building man pages from Rdoc comments.
 
 
Version: 0.1.0 [2005-07-26]

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES:

 * Created.  Since May 2002, there has been a trial version of an RSPEngine
   class in the R.io package, but from now on this package should be used for
   RSP processing.  The RSPEngine class is made deprecated.
