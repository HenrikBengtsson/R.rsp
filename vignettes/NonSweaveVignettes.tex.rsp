\begin{abstract}
This document describes how to include RSP and other non-Sweave vignettes in R packages such that they appear in the R help system.  
As described in the first part of this document, generic support for vignettes of any format (not only Sweave) was added in R~v3.0.0 making it straightforward to include vignettes of any format including RSP-embedded vignettes.

To include non-Sweave vignettes in packages to be used also in version prior to R~v3.0.0, the \pkg{R.rsp} package provides framework that is forward compatible with the R~v3.0.0 framework.  A package developer only needs to copy three files (\file{dummy.Rnw}, \file{Makefile} and \file{.install\_extras}) "as is" in order for the latter to work.

  BACKGROUND
  -------------------------------------------------------------------%>
\section{Background}
When building an R package, Sweave/LaTeX vignettes are recognized by R, compiled into PDFs, which are listed along with their source in the R help system, e.g. \code{help.start()}.  These package vignettes are also being listed online on the CRAN and Bioconductor package pages.


<%-------------------------------------------------------------------
  R v3.0.0 and beyond
  -------------------------------------------------------------------%>
\section{Vignettes in R v3.0.0 and beyond}
Starting with R~v3.0.0, it is possible to include vignettes of any vignette format in R packages (not only Sweave).  This is handled via a so called \emph{vignette engine} mechanism that utilizes so called \emph{vignette builder} packages such as \pkg{R.rsp}, \pkg{knitr} and \pkg{noweb}.  
For instance, a package that wish to include RSP vignettes using the \pkg{R.rsp} package, should add the following to its \file{DESCRIPTION} file
{\begin{verbatim}
Suggests: R.rsp
VignetteBuilder: R.rsp
\end{verbatim}}
and the following to each of the RSP vignettes (typically as part of an RSP comment)
{\begin{verbatim}
%\VignetteEngine{R.rsp::rsp}
\end{verbatim}}
This will cause all \file{*.rsp} vignettes to be compiled and part of the package.  Similar approaches can used for other types of vignettes, e.g. knitr and noweb.  It is also possible to use a mix of vignette formats in the same package.  For more details on how vignette are included in packages, see Section `Writing package vignettes' of `Writing R Extensions' part of your R installation (for instance via \code{help.start()}).


<%-------------------------------------------------------------------
  Prior to R v3.0.0
  -------------------------------------------------------------------%>
\section{Vignettes before R v3.0.0}
The instructions given in this section are intended for packages that are to be built and installed on R systems prior to R v3.0.0.  They are such they are forward compatible with the recent R~v3.0.0 vignette framework.  This makes it particularly easy to include vignettes in packages that are supposed to support both newer and older versions of R.

\begin{center}
\emph{If your package is only intended for R~v3.0.0 and beyond, none of the below applies.}
\end{center}


<%-------------------------------------------------------------------
  USING THE DEFAULT R FRAMEWORK
  -------------------------------------------------------------------%>
\subsection{Using the default R framework}
Unfortunately, in versions R~v2.14.0 to R~v2.15.3, static PDFs are not recognized and therefore not listed.  Same is true for other PDFs that are dynamically generated during build by other means, e.g. RSP-embedded LaTeX documents.  Fortunately, there is a framework to include also non-Sweave vignettes, as explained next.


\subsubsection{Include static PDFs}
\label{secStaticPDF}
Assume you have a static PDF named \file{manual.pdf} that you wish to include in your package.  Then place it in the \file{vignettes/} directory of the package and create a corresponding \file{manual.Rnw} stub (in the same directory) that contains:
\begin{alltt}
%{\bs}VignetteIndexEntry\{User manual\}
{\bs}documentclass\{article\}
{\bs}begin\{document\}
...
{\bs}end\{document\}
\end{alltt}
The above is a minimal valid Sweave document that is recognized by the R build system and will therefore \emph{trigger} the vignette installation to take place.
This small addition will make the PDF vignette appear when calling \code{browseVignettes()} as well as in the `Overview of user guides and package vignettes' section of the package HTML help page (via \code{help.start()}).  The drawback is that also the above "dummy" \file{manual.Rnw} will be listed.


<%-------------------------------------------------------------------
  RSP VIGNETTES
  -------------------------------------------------------------------%>
\subsection{Using the extended framework of the R.rsp package}
<% pathMk <- file.path("doc", "templates", fsep="/"); %>
Here we describe how to dynamically build and include non-Sweave vignettes, such as, but not limited to, RSP-embedded LaTeX vignettes.  In order to do this, three files needs to be available in \file{vignettes/}:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \file{dummy.Rnw}: A "dummy" Sweave vignette file triggering R's vignette installation procedures, and
  \item \file{Makefile}: A file with instructions emulating the post-3.0.0 R vignette mechanisms, and
  \item \file{.install\_extras}: A file specifying which (source and generated output) vignette files to \emph{install}\footnote{The term \emph{install} is used for vignettes to make it explicit that the orignal source files are located in \file{vignettes/}, but when compiled are copied together with the output files to \file{inst/doc/} of the built package.  Directory \file{vignettes/} is \emph{not} installed to, and therefore not available in, the built package.}.
\end{enumerate}
These files can be copied "as is" from the \pkg{R.rsp} package (see Appendix for its content) to the new package's \file{vignettes/} directory using:
\begin{verbatim}
filenames <- c("dummy.Rnw", "Makefile", ".install_extras")
pathS <- system.file("<%=pathMk%>", package="R.rsp")
pathD <- "vignettes"
dir.create(pathD)
pathnamesS <- file.path(pathS, gsub("^[.]", ",", filenames))
pathnamesD <- file.path(pathD, filenames)
file.copy(pathnamesS, to=pathnamesD)
\end{verbatim}
Neither of these files need to be edited\footnote{The reason for the \code{gsub()} renaming is because R does not allow the last file to installed starting with a period.  Instead with use a comma as a workaround.}.  Note that the Makefile and the functions it utilizes are independent of the RSP markup language why it can also be used for other vignette formats as well.
The use of custom \file{vignettes/Makefile} and \file{vignettes/.install\_extras} files is described in Section `Writing package vignettes' of `Writing R Extensions'.


\subsubsection{Improved HTML overview of vignettes}
By default, the R HTML help system will list links to the PDF and the Sweave source of the vignettes.  This means that above approach for including static PDFs in a package will also list the Rnw stub in this listing.
As explained in `Writing R Extensions', it is possible to override this by providing a custom \file{vignettes/index.html} file.
It can be tedious the manually edit the \file{index.html} file.  For this reason, if the \file{index.html} file is missing, then the above \file{Makefile} automatically builds one and populates it with the PDF and source files available according to what the vignette files specify (see also below).


\subsubsection{Include RSP-embedded LaTeX vignettes}
\label{secRSPVignette}
Assume you have an RSP-embedded LaTeX vignette named \file{manual.tex.rsp} that you wish to automatically build and have the PDF and the source being include in your package.  In order for this to happen, it must be contain \code{{\bs}Vignette*\{\}} markup as illustrated below:
\begin{alltt}
%{\bs}VignetteIndexEntry\{User manual\}
%{\bs}VignetteEngine\{R.rsp::rsp\}
{\bs}documentclass\{article\}
{\bs}begin\{document\}
...
{\bs}end\{document\}
\end{alltt}
Make sure these statements are given as LaTeX-style comments in your vignette source document.
The \emph{mandatory} \code{{\bs}VignetteIndexEntry\{\}} markup sets the title of the vignette as it will appear in the R vignette index.
The \code{{\bs}VignetteEngine\{\}} markup specifies which vignette engine to use for compiling this vignette source file.  This markup is actually only available in R~v3.0.0, but we use it here too and somewhat imitates its behavior such that it works in any version of R.  This is all taken care of by the \pkg{R.rsp} package.

<%--
\subsubsection{Include non-RSP non-Sweave vignettes}
\label{secNonRSPVignette}
Again, note that this solution is non-specific to RSP vignettes and can be used by vignettes of any format.
In order for this to work in R prior to R~v3.0.0, you also have to specify add a \code{enginesMap.R} file to \code{vignettes/} that looks like:
{\scriptsize\begin{verbatim}
<%=
pathname <- system.file(pathMk, "enginesMap.R", package="R.rsp");
bfr <- readLines(pathname, warn=FALSE);
paste(bfr, collapse="\n");
%>
\end{verbatim}}
When building vignettes via the Makefile, this file will be sourced to define vignette compile functions that have names equal to the ones specified by the \code{{\bs}VignetteEngine\{\}} statements in your vignettes.

\section*{Appendix}
\subsection*{The generic Makefile file}
\label{appMakefile}
The customized and generic \file{Makefile} that builds non-Sweave vignettes and any missing \file{index.html} file is available in \pkg{R.rsp} package directory \file{<%=pathMk%>/}.  This \file{Makefile} should be copied ``as is'' to \file{vignettes/} of your package.  Its content is:
{\scriptsize\begin{verbatim}
<%=
pathname <- system.file(pathMk, "Makefile", package="R.rsp");
bfr <- readLines(pathname, warn=FALSE);
rr <- grep("^# HISTORY", bfr);
if (length(rr) > 0) {
  bfr <- bfr[1:(rr-2L)];
}
bfr <- gsub("\t", "    ", bfr, fixed=TRUE);
paste(bfr, collapse="\n");
%>
\end{verbatim}}


\subsection*{The generic .install\_extras file}
\label{appInstallExtreas}
The \file{vignettes/.install\_extras} file controls which source and output vignette files should be installed and therefore be copied to the \file{inst/doc/} directory of the built package.  The generic \file{.install\_extras} file available by in \pkg{R.rsp} package directory \file{<%=pathMk%>/} contains:
{\scriptsize\begin{verbatim}
<%=
pathname <- system.file(pathMk, ",install_extras", package="R.rsp");
bfr <- readLines(pathname, warn=FALSE);
rr <- grep("^# HISTORY", bfr);
if (length(rr) > 0) {
  bfr <- bfr[1:(rr-2L)];
}
bfr <- gsub("\t", "    ", bfr, fixed=TRUE);
paste(bfr, collapse="\n");
%>
\end{verbatim}}


\subsection*{The "trigger" dummy.Rnw file}
\label{appInstallExtreas}
The "dummy" Sweave source file \file{dummy.Rnw} file available by in \pkg{R.rsp} package directory \file{<%=pathMk%>/}, which triggers R's vignette installation mechanism to process the \file{vignettes/Makefile}, contains:
{\scriptsize\begin{verbatim}
<%=
pathname <- system.file(pathMk, "dummy.Rnw", package="R.rsp");
bfr <- readLines(pathname, warn=FALSE);
rr <- grep("^# HISTORY", bfr);
if (length(rr) > 0) {
  bfr <- bfr[1:(rr-2L)];
}
bfr <- gsub("\t", "    ", bfr, fixed=TRUE);
paste(bfr, collapse="\n");
%>
\end{verbatim}}



\subsection*{The files used for creating this document}
\label{appThisRnw}
This document was created from the RSP-embedded LaTeX vignette \file{NonSweaveVignettes.tex.rsp} that is \emph{installed} in the \file{doc/} package directory of \pkg{R.rsp}.  It can manually be compiled into a PDF as:
\begin{verbatim}
pathname <- system.file("doc/NonSweaveVignettes.tex.rsp", package="R.rsp")
R.rsp::file(pathname)
\end{verbatim}
The generated PDF can then be included into the package as a static PDF (as explained in Section~\ref{secStaticPDF}).
However, in this package we have chosen to build it dynamically during package build, by adding the RSP file to \file{vignettes/} as explained above.

\subsection*{Session information}
<%=toLatex(sessionInfo())%>
This report was automatically generated using \code{rfile()} of the R.rsp package.
Total processing time after RSP-to-R translation was <%=dt <- round(Sys.time()-t0, digits=2)%> <%=attr(dt, "units")%>.
