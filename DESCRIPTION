Description: An RSP document is a text-based document containing an R-embedded template of the final document, e.g. "Today's date is <%=Sys.Date()%>".  An RSP document is preprocessed, parsed and translated into an R script, which when sourced generates the final document.  This way it is possible to dynamically generate reports in plain text, HTML, TeX etc, e.g. "\includegraphics{<%=toPDF('Normal', { curve(dnorm, from=-5, to=+5) })%>}".  It can also be used to enhance other literate programming languages such as Sweave, e.g. "<<eval=<%=doEval%>>>= [...] @".  In addition to RSP, this package also provides an internal cross-platform web server and built-in dynamic RSP-embedded HTML help pages, which can be launched by browseRsp().  If other packages provide RSP help pages, these are automatically linked to as well.
