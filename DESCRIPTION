Description: An R Server Page (RSP) is a document that contains both text in a format of choice (HTML, TeX, Rnw, ...) as well as R source code within special tags.  An RSP file can be translated into a so called R servlet, which is an R script that outputs the final document when sourced.  This way documents in any format can be generated dynamically using R, e.g. automatic reports of statistical analysis.  Utilizing an internal cross-platform web server, this package provides dynamic help pages in HTML.  If other packages provide RSP help pages, these are automatically linked to in the RSP main menu.
